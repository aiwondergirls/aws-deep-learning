                ","
Hour in which I consider hydrangea, a salt or sand plant, varietal, the question of varietals, the diet of every mother I know, 5 pounds feels like 20, I have lost … I have lost, yes, a sense of my own possible beauty, grown external, I externalize beauty. Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. His hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him. Why should he consider what is all around him? Perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. I am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.

Toward summer or its dependence
On demarcations in the sandy vial
Some tree spelling astronaut onto a
Planet’s arm, it stopped making sense.

Or a dog by the 15th hole, I am not
A light sparking a whole country’s demise.
I will never be a towel holding someone’s
Sunscreen while they wash it off in foreign
Seas. My hair goes up and down, it’s true
As it is I am not a bag of tea nor will I ever
Be exceptionally happy. Let the director
Know I was distressed by the construction
Noise, that I had no known allergies that
My parents convinced me I was wanted
And why wouldn’t you believe them.

Invention I preferred to ignore in the

                    Finding My Mother
                ","
Near dusk I find her in a newly mown field, lying still
and face down in the coarse stubble. Her arms
 
are splayed out on either side of her body, palms open
and turned upward like two lilies, the slender fingers
 
gently curling, as if holding onto something. Her legs
are drawn up underneath her, as if she fell asleep there
 
on her knees, perhaps while praying, perhaps intoxicated
by the sweet liquid odor of sheared grass.
 
Her small ankles, white and unscarred, are crossed
one on top of the other, as if arranged so in ritual fashion.
 
Her feet are bare. I cannot see her face, turned
toward the ground as it is,
 
but her long black hair is lovelier than I remember it,
spilling across her back and down onto the felled stalks
 
like a pour of glossy tar. Her flesh is smooth
and cool, slightly resistant to my touch.
 
I begin to look around me for something with which
to carry her back—carry her back, I hear myself say,
 
as if the words spoken aloud, even in a dream,
will somehow make it possible.
 
I am alone in a field, at dusk, the light leaving
the way it has to, leaking away the way it has to
 
behind a ridge of swiftly blackening hills. I lie down
on the ground beside my mother under falling darkness
 
and draw my coat over our bodies. We sleep there like that.

When he called, there were 261 emotions
at play. I thought there were only wistfulness,
humiliation, and mere bitterness left, but lo,
I see now the brilliance in the numbers. 
Emotions 75 and 78 made me happy just to know
they existed. I felt less alone, more impervious. 
I was emboldened by the existence of 152. 
Though, how was I supposed to accept 9, 14, and 179?
We deserved better, distress and indigence aside. 
Something about 260 broke the spell inside me

                ","
Inside every world there is another world trying to get out,
and there is something in you that would like to discount this world. 
The stars could rise in darkness over heartbreaking coasts, 
and you would not know if you were ruining your life or beginning a real one. 
You could claim professional fondness for the world around you; 
the pictures would dissolve under the paint coming alive,
and you would only feel a phantom skip of the heart, absorbed so in the colors. 
Your disbelief is a later novel emerging in the long, long shadow of an earlier one—
is this the great world, which is whatever is the case?
The sustained helplessness you feel in the long emptiness of days is matched
by the new suspiciousness and wrath you wake to each morning. 
Isn’t this a relationship with your death, too, to fall in love with your inscrutable life?
Your teeth fill with cavities. There is always unearned happiness for some, 
and the criminal feeling of solitude. Always, everyone lies about his life.

Once again, someone falls in their first falling–fall of two bodies, of two eyes, of four green eyes or eight green eyes if we count those born in the mirror (at midnight, in the purest fear, in the loss), you haven’t been able to recognize the voice of your dull silence, to see the earthly messages scrawled in the middle of one mad state, when the body is a glass and from ourselves and from the other we drink some kind of impossible water.
         Desire needlessly spills on me a cursed liqueur. For my thirsty thirst, what can the promise of eyes do? I speak of something not in this world. I speak of someone whose purpose is elsewhere.
         And I was naked in memory of the white night. Drunk and I made love all night, just like a sick dog.
         Sometimes we suffer too much reality in the space of a single night. We get undressed, we’re horrified. We’re aware the mirror sounds like a watch, the mirror from which your cry will pour out, your laceration.
         Night opens itself only once. It’s enough. You see. You’ve seen. Fear of being two in the mirror, and suddenly we’re four. We cry, we moan, my fear, my joy more horrible than my fear, my visceral words, my words are keys that lock me into a mirror, with you, but ever alone. And I am well aware what night is made of. We’ve fallen so completely into jaws that didn’t expect this sacrifice, this condemnation of my eyes which have seen. I speak of a discovery: felt the I in sex, sex in the I. I speak of burying everyday fear to secure the fear of an instant. The purest loss. But who’ll say: you don’t cry anymore at night? Because madness is also a lie. Like night. Like death.

All night I hear the noise of water sobbing. All night I make night in me, I make the day that begins on my account, that sobs because day falls like water through night.
         All night I hear the voice of someone seeking me out. All night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling. All night I write luminous messages, messages of rain, all night someone checks for me and I check for someone.
         The noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia. Steps of someone who no longer writhes, who no longer writes. All night someone holds back, then crosses the circle of bitter light.
         All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes. All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence. All night I see something lurch toward my looking, something humid, contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing.
         Absence blows grayly and night goes dense. Night, the shade of the eyelids of the dead, viscous night, exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth, without cold. All night I flee from someone. I lead the chase, I lead the fugue. I sing a song of mourning. Black birds over black shrouds. My brain cries. Demented wind. I leave the tense and strained hand, I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing, this clatter in the night, this delay, this infamy, this pursuit, this inexistence.
         All night I see that abandonment is me, that the sole sobbing voice is me. We can search with lanterns, cross the shadow’s lie. We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart.
         All night I ask you why. All night you tell me no.

2  The Miniature Bed
A miniature bed, and in it two tiny people
not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,

3  Harvest
 
The fields are a book of uses.
Near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
Dust rises up and replaces itself.
A quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.
 
In the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
We flourish.
All around us, things flourish.
Cows strain the fence with their abundance.
The herd makes a sound like swelling.
 
Out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth.     
4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth
 
The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
It was August, haying season. My tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school
for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn
I watched him shoot the calf in the head.
He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't
have to get married. I let my feet go black
from burned grasses. It never gets easier
he said, kicking straw over the blood patch.
She went down so quiet it was almost
sad. Later, when my tooth fell out, I buried it
under my pillow and it grew into money.     
5  Talisman
 
Waiting for the school bus you find
the femur of a baby animal
on the ground. You carry
that femur in your pocket
the entire morning and touch it
secretly through the cloth.
When the teacher asks
a question you don't raise
your hand but quietly
wrap your fingers around
the thin shape, that bone
without a mother.     
6  On Waking
 
Half of everything is invisible.
A river drifts below the river.
A gesture lost in the body.
Wind moves through the open
windows of the trees.
 
Beyond the day, another day.
 
Dreamed I was drowning
my mother's silk laundry
in the river,
kneeling on the wet rocks.
Back and forth I drowned it
in the gray clouds...     
7  Eros
 
Each year fish run the green vein of the river.
The bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain.
 
From a fragment of a Greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
A skeleton has the same intelligence.
 
So that when a girl discovers it,
loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.     
8  A Childhood
 
The horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
He held still in the sunblazed pasture.
For a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.
He was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. He listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
A jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
Everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
The excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
As if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.

                ","
 I came here, being stricken, stumbling out
At last from streets; the sun, decreasing, took me
For days, the time being the last of autumn,
The thickets not yet stark, but quivering
With tiny colors, like some brush strokes in
The manner of the pointillists; small yellows
Dart shaped, little reds in different pattern,
Clicks and notches of color on threaded bushes,
A cracked and fluent heaven, and a brown earth.
I had these, and my food and sleep—enough.
 
This is a countryside of roofless houses,—
Taverns to rain,—doorsteps of millstones, lintels
Leaning and delicate, foundations sprung to lilacs.
Orchards where boughs like roots strike into the sky.
Here I could well devise the journey to nothing,
At night getting down from the wagon by the black barns,
The zenith a point of darkness, breaking to bits,
Showering motionless stars over the houses.
Scenes relentless—the black and white grooves of a woodcut.
 
But why the journey to nothing or any desire?
Why the heart taken by even senseless adventure,
The goal a coffer of dust?    Give my mouth to the air,
Let arrogant pain lick my flesh with a tongue
Rough as a cat’s; remember the smell of cold mornings,
The dried beauty of women, the exquisite skin
Under the chins of young girls, young men’s rough beards,—
The cringing promise of this one, that one’s apology
For the knife struck down to the bone, gladioli in sick rooms,
Asters and dahlias, flowers like ruches, rosettes. . .
 
Forever enough to part grass over the stones
By some brook or well, the lovely seed-shedding stalks;
To hear in the single wind diverse branches
Repeating their sounds to the sky—that sky like scaled mackerel,
Fleeing the fields—to be defended from silence,
To feel my body as arid, as safe as a twig
Broken away from whatever growth could snare it
Up to a spring, or hold it softly in summer
Or beat it under in snow.
 
                                                       I must get well.
Walk on strong legs, leap the hurdles of sense,  
Reason again, come back to my old patchwork logic,
Addition, subtraction, money, clothes, clocks,
Memories (freesias, smelling slightly of snow and of flesh
In a room with blue curtains) ambition, despair.
I must feel again who had given feeling over,
Challenge laughter, take tears, play the piano,
Form judgments, blame a crude world for disaster.
 
To escape is nothing.    Not to escape is nothing.
The farmer’s wife stands with a halo of darkness
Rounding her head.    Water drips in the kitchen
Tapping the sink.    To-day the maples have split
Limb from the trunk with the ice, a fresh wooden wound.
The vines are distorted with ice, ice burdens the breaking
Roofs I have told you of.

 I burned my life, that I might find
A passion wholly of the mind,
Thought divorced from eye and bone,
Ecstasy come to breath alone.
I broke my life, to seek relief
From the flawed light of love and grief.
 
With mounting beat the utter fire
Charred existence and desire.
It died low, ceased its sudden thresh.
I had found unmysterious flesh—
Not the mind’s avid substance—still
Passionate beyond the will.

Since you would claim the sources of my thoughtRecall the meshes whence it sprang unlimed,The reedy traps which other hands have timedTo close upon it. Conjure up the hotBlaze that it cleared so cleanly, or the snowDevised to strike it down. It will be free.Whatever nets draw in to prison meAt length your eyes must turn to watch it go.
 My mouth, perhaps, may learn one thing too well,My body hear no echo save its own,Yet will the desperate mind, maddened and proud,Seek out the storm, escape the bitter spellThat we obey, strain to the wind, be thrownStraight to its freedom in the thunderous cloud.

All my life I’ve asked my master
Why I am unable to choose
This sweet man or fancy shoes
Over this stranger, more difficult lover
And these expensive but practical loafers
And why I am unable to author
A book exhibiting my full potential
And have focused instead on inconsequential
Letters to strange and difficult lovers
Who by my letters were never changed.
I certainly haven’t been constrained
By terrible parents or trauma or poverty
And even if I had it wouldn’t explain
My propensity for misery
Anymore than it would my
Propensity for joy.
Maybe I’m just a procrastinator
As life is a procrastination of death
And each breath just a procrastination of breath
And friends a procrastination of work
And work a procrastination of love
And love a procrastination I’m just not above.

We come down from the mountains. Yellow trees, green trees. I was leaving Earth but, before I did, I had to get rid of all my animals. My main one, my main model for behavior, was my snake. He was attached to the bottom of my foot but had become dangerous seeming and I was afraid he would bite me if he got the chance. My sister was there and I said, “Before I leave, I have to get rid of all my animals,” thinking maybe she’d help me. I said, “My horse, my frog, my snake…” but didn’t mention I was worried about how to dislodge my snake safely. As I was waking up, I thought of going to a place where they could give the snake a shot to knock it out or even kill it before they tried to get it off my foot.

One of the spectators is disappointed
there isn’t a guide to explain
the beaching, the scientists busy
cutting into ninety-four pilot whales
stranded on the salt grass.
No one knows why and, try as the rescue team
might, not one whale will go back to water.
So they’re injected to speed up the dying,
 
lined up like lumber and sawed into,
except when the black skin splits
we can’t stop staring, their meat is so red.
I don’t want to know why this happens—
what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly
finished their love of motion. Why should
anything have to leave this world
when water can cycle from atmosphere
down to land, the ocean and back
to forgiving sky.
 
                                      I’m on my way to Connecticut

on his heart valve—that’s how the intern
describes it, trying to minimize
the danger of him slipping
into a haze so cold, some nights,
bone-cold, his hand can’t get from
his plate to his mouth.
 
                                                  Rain slicks the highway
slowing me down. The same water
fattened into snow in the woods
of my childhood, the whiteness
unbroken except where my father
cut trails and taught me to ski,
laying down the herringbone behind him
as he broke up hills that left me
with legs made of slush. He wanted me strong,
no patience for pain. No choice
but to find the muscle to follow. Even now
when he boasts how I zigzagged
the breakneck hills in an icestorm,
there’s no hint of my knee-chattering fear,
slats skittering out of control,
each run a victory of luck more than will,
each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
I wonder how it is for him now
there in the ward where whiteness can’t hide
the cold blank that’s ahead. When the whales
beached, spectators came like pilgrims,
each new arrival scanning the faces
of those heading back to their cars
to see how it changed them
to survey so much death. Nothing showed.
Their eyes followed the asphalt,
heads bent in private devotion.
 
                                                    There in a room
where others have died, my father
keeps a record of each test and drug.
He watches medicine drip into his arm
and circle in the dark of his blood.
I believe it will heal him, as I believe
in the strength of my blood
to protect me from failures of will. Once
when my grandmother at ninety-six
lay delirious with pneumonia,
pitching on her high horsehair bed,
she saw three crows perched on the dresser.
 
              They smell so awful, she said.Please, open the window. Let them out.
It was my father who did what she asked.
And the crows flew out, carrying her fever
over the treeline, dissolving into sky,
and she lived. Whatever she saw,
by love, luck or dumb Yankee will,
it was true. That’s what I mean by medicine.

In the heavy fashion magazines strewn here and there around the house the photos of objects and people mouth the word “money,” but you, assuming no one wants you anymore, mishear the message as “meaning.” Arousal follows. The lives of the rich are so fabulous! The destruction of the poetical lies heavily on their hands, as on their swollen notion that we are always watching. There is nothing behind the mask. Nothing suffocating under its pressure, no human essence trying to get out.
     Awareness, always awareness. Don’t you see how these elaborate masks are turning you into a zombie? The private life is not for the eye but for the endless interior. It is trying to push all this crap aside and find the missing line. Nobody, least of all the future, cares about the outcome of this quest.

Running on this way she used various modes of expression that
were current.  Nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer.
What Woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the
woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility
of her mind.  At the Philadelphia Flower Show, an ideal situation
was built up.  Here through various regulated artificial conditions,
spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed
her ideal concept of nature.  The smell was overpowering.
All right then.  She had a thing about nature, from flower
show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated.
A beauty of cultivation—in living?  Hastiness did not prevent
her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd
conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, “OH OH
the life I am entangled in.”  Four sides of it.
                                                                                        Above was a paradisical
level, incompleted.  With working possibilities.
Below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible.
Currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new
bedspread and color scheme for pillows.
                                                                               Taste treats were
unresponsive.  Glamor do’s were out.  Conversation was nil.
Languid
she could not even find a place to languish upon that was
fulfilling in its own way.
                            So out of the lifelessness that was around her,
the grape leaves drying out, and even though the avocado was
sprouting,
she thought, Why not fantasy?  Tugging at this character and
that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half-
blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller.  Here the four
walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again.  “I ought
to tighten down and make sure I say exactly what I mean.”
And her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch
economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way.  Use every
tidbit, usefully.  Once upon a time there was a princess who
had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the
coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors.
The princess languished.  She was not sure where to sit to her best
advantage to enjoy herself the most.  She could not go in her mind
or out.  She looked at her long white hand, I am the Queen of the
High Mountain Hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was
a princess.  She lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of
eden, the coat spread around her.
                                                                No, that poor little house she
had built was a bore.  It’s better that it go up in flames, as it did.
She went down to Grand Central Station and gave away flowers.
Some people took them and some people didn’t.

I’m glad to get back.  I had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey.
Questioning myself all along the way.  Was I jumping on her because
her time had come to an end.  Indeed I pounded on his arm all night,
over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, I can see nothing
but their softness.  Me ME, and the time we might spend together,
reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk.
My flippancy is gone.  Now I have started my secret life again,
in transition, reminding.  As the moth reminds, its feeble antenna
groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money.
All over I was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent.
It was a cold night out.  It was colder still between the airy gaps,
between blankets.
                                     You can see she is thoughtful
as she draws the string to the bow.  Where to go indeed.  The
point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly.
A sleeping angel or a sleeping troll?  I was rather proud of being
used, pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown
street.  Here, pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations,
drawing from their bags, long lists of memorandum due, what I owed.
It was a lot, if I hesitated.  I choose to go on, saying this is the
way I go, owing nothing, being that kind of person.  Hung up?
That thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly
marked.  Certainly one supposes in all honesty, that an essential
core of feeling blooms in each encounter.  Lost under the weight
of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent.
Thus unhappy, I don’t want it to be this way, and so forth.
Not costumes, or paraphernalia, the immediate reactions.
4.
We of course are in a family situation.  Anything I wish might
happen, but the larger situations are not real, not to be
considered possible, discussable as to what sense of reality
they possessed.
In the snow, the wood piled up underneath.  Oh those drifting
sensibilities.  At this point it is scarcely believable that people
gather and like each other.  Eating chocolate pudding, getting
in touch with some other sense of alikeness.  The form is no
longer obvious to me.  Whether they meander or are joined together
in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along.
                                                     I suspect that in this house, this
place that is musty and left as it was some years ago, there is
no real fear; the objects are old and I am not familiar with them,
only the sense that the Ghost or spirit world strikes you with
its familiarity, pleasurable fear.
                                                           Here the familiar
is apt to make its presence known, at any moment the unexpected
lurk in the hall, into the room.  Pieces of leather, old silken fans
laid upon the table top, rooms filled with something left unexpectedly
terror is the wrong combination of ignorance.  It contains its own
self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe.  100 pieces of voice
with no name, called it myself, as they spoke all day, sucking the
soft slush, admitting their real deficiencies as—
I am never sure; Oh it’s that power
and disease of believing in the stale that doesn’t demand a real
climate, takes its capacity when the demons come down.
5.
The night passes in night time.  The head moving to the shoulder,
the head rising with a frown.
In a firm voice, it doesn’t matter if the hair is flying from undue
spring breezes, the self has been raptured on the wine that produces
appropriate madness, and sad she says, my dear the bacchanal is a
lovely way to be rid of waste.
However, in seeing the house more manageable, one cannot even have
fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which
refuses to sink.
                                                                                  There once was a woman
who grew older, not that she minded, but the passage of time was
always constant.  Why does one have to contend with that she said,
puzzled, as she got carried along, and constantly had to think up
new coping modes of behavior.  If he behaved to me thus when he was
40, now that I am 30, I can hardly behave like that to those that are
20, and so forth.  There wasn’t any model except the one she built,
and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern.  This
offered wonderful possibilities, but also indecision and gutlessness.
6.
You can’t see them, all bundled up, all those that choose
to move other than where the distance seems appealing.  Knowledge
has no depth.  There isn’t any message to be spoken.
Wrangling, she speaks ill-advised my dear, as the cat has no
point in laying its head down.  She ought to watch carefully.
                                                                             The claws.  It could be
the bent hands, as they grow, that as the fur impeaches the
rose, doesn’t make the thing she hangs her body on any realer.
What could it be all about?  The necessity to follow, balancing,
contemplating words, as the basis of why we move at all.
Just a little touch.  The leader cautioned further progression.
I could hardly listen to the music for long.  Now there
seemed to be interruptions, pleasurable interludes, nothing
definite, of a fragmented nature.
                                                               Certainly I wished the best
for all.  The sadder soldiers stumbled idly, as I also in the
profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns, the
twisting statements grooving into the language building something
to listen to.  The dress made from silk.  Trusting was awkward
and not of a nature to ease any further building.  Whosoever
you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the
burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of
communication.
7.
I am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort.  However, as
dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas, how did those arise, from
a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund.
Knowledge comes from what purported strike?  From that which cleanses,
and let us knot say “heart” but tissue.  Hopefully and helpfully I have
built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep.  Not for purposes
of letting in the cold.
                                         However, I have found that not all blockaded
against is the cold, the dreary reign of the dead, etc., and tasteless
realm of the mushroom.  As much can be denied as the bilious sun
strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and
the head.  That is uncorraled ecstasy.  I call it enthusiasm, free energy.
But it has no place to land, it is bursting and unfocused; it is a real force
and the counterpart of the gloomy depths.
                                                                              As the pieces of the house
ooze sap, blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks.  Whether or
not to join in what I was half committed to see and do.
8.
At this point, when Jack picked up the pussy willow branches, I said
they can’t possibly be ours for the taking, and smiled with dedication
to an older Con Edison man.  The buildings were like the unexplored
garbage in my mind, fascinating and dirty, pulling pieces of cloth
from boxes left overnight.  Energy as limitless possibility, in
the attempt to transmit non-energy situations.
For example, if once I stop to realize what little gets through, I am
much more interested in the cover than the contents; it is difficult
to find any interest in anything.  Good energy displaces bad karma.
And other non entities like that sort, producing flow that in its own
place has a good bed, stocked well with what can be called fleet-footed
fishes, and approaching places of investigation, such as relations
between.
                    As I saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin, I
forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from
something I have never seen; more possibly the components of what
every man views.  If this was a possibility, the rays from every person
converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without
any mind at all, for this horror fits the cat on the stairs, between
the fifth and sixth rung.  This is the way people glow and pulse similar
to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way, full of human life; until
I who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be
blocked on the way, although I turn back gladly, and will again swim
through for it is possible they do not kill, the sting’s compounded measure
is fear, and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths
calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition
or orifices, stomachs and legs.
I reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing
themselves.  She ignored her face, blotched and red upon times, but
fuller.  Did you forget to wax and wane?  Her head was full of energy
brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious
into color, but no sense.  Sense was for the thinkers.  Here the thinkers
forgot their word orders or sense; it was better to give them coffee,
and those off worse could smoke.
                                                                                          I had felt very
foolish when I leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and
his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the
way.  And I followed for certainly no one would follow me.  As the day
is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and
nature.  These words, like Nature, and Head, Thinking and Words,
repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off
sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition.  Light
was such an enormous possibility.  Taking sight into a frenzy, it was
possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for
ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street
where cars had gone by.
                                                  I worried about certain characters: ones
that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but I was drawn to
them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding?
As when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became
distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled
with the stuff of continuity.  The sorrow that each day sinks into the
infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and
does its rituals.  Memory has its own screen across the room to view
itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form
in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes.
                                                                  New York. January – March, 1967

You slow down to watch cumulus clouds stream across the
sky. You choose a more circuitous route home and pass a
tree with white bags tied around random apples. The apples
remind you of clouds, how each hangs in the sky, singular
yet part of a flock. Each item in the flock is a coordinate of
earth and sky, enumerating space. The flocks of apples and
clouds are actual infinities, an endless collection of discrete
items that one can conceivably count to the end. This is
different from potential infinity, which is the entirety of
infinity, an immeasurable continuum that is greater than the
sum of its parts. After your first glimpse, you are lonely for
more contraction of space around the light of your mind
contemplating what cannot be conceived. What cannot be
conceived this morning? The Army has found the larynx of
an Iraqi man that American soldiers slowly strangled to
death. His ribs, additional evidence for the trial, are still
missing. They are in a refrigerator in Washington, D.C.
These are discrete items; whereas how the passage of time
felt as the soldiers strangled him is a continuum of infinite
pain. And his words and songs and prayers and curses he
will never speak are an empty set.

and they cannot see the claw on the handle,
the animal hand
that haunts them
from some place inside their blood.
 
So that is hunting, birth,
and one kind of death.
Then there was medicine, the healing of wounds.
Red was the infinite fruit
of stolen bodies.
The doctors wanted to know
what invented disease
how wounds healed
from inside themselves
how life stands up in skin,
if not by magic.
 
They divined the red shadows of leeches
that swam in white bowls of water:
they believed stars
in the cup of sky.
They cut the wall of skin
to let
what was bad escape
but they were reading the story of fire
gone out
and that was a science.
 
As for the animal hand on death’s knife,
knives have as many sides
as the red father of war
who signs his name
in the blood of other men.
 
And red was the soldier
who crawled
through a ditch
of human blood in order to live.
It was the canal of his deliverance.
It is his son who lives near me.
Red is the thunder in our ears
when we meet.
Love, like creation,
is some other order of things.
 
Red is the share of fire
I have stolen
from root, hoof, fallen fruit.
And this was hunger.
 
Red is the human house
I come back to at night
swimming inside the cave of skin
that remembers bison.
In that round nation
of blood
we are all burning,
red, inseparable fires
the living have crawled
and climbed through
in order to live
so nothing will be left
for death at the end.
 
This life in the fire, I love it.
I want it,
this life.

A cloud, the absence of a noun, no name,

The mind explodes in the dark of space,
unnursed by atmospheres,
as air raid sirens scream for blood
and I am only nerves, strung on constellations,
meridians and vectors quivering. A red and yellow
capsule invades the chemistry of thought; cathode rays blast
from the television screen and signals pass deep into space
until the stars are singing “Rosalita.” You
will not remember this night.

1.
 
After twenty I stopped counting,
not like my friend Beverly, who sewed
an embroidered satin star on her bell-bottoms
for every new guy she fucked.
She had them running down both legs
and around the billowing hem,
and was starting up the inseam
when the jeans gave out in the wash.
 
It was a boys’ game anyway, those years
of our extended homage to the penis:
the guitar playing the penis, drums saluting it,
cock rock, Molotov cocktail, the motorcycle
gripped between the thighs, and I went down,
we all went down, in the old cultural disaster
of idol worship—a thousand-year bender.
Only this time it was the adolescent member,
oiled and laved, thrust forward arcing,
thin with ache, all tight flesh poked upward,
claiming its own. How it came and went,
penetrating but never settling down,
and how often we were caused to admire it:
hairless sweet warrior, raider against the State.
 
But I have this sweet pink flower
here between my legs—I put my hand down and touch it,
still soft and wet, and many-folded, endlessly opening,
hiding, seeking, hidden and sought,
but never very much admired or even smiled on
in those years, never served much less sung to.
Not a garden then but a citadel,
a wall to be breached, a new land claimed,
but linger there? No, I would say
there was an overall lack of appreciation,
 
though breasts were well respected, slopping loose
under T-shirts like little animals,
and I would feel my nipples brush the cotton
with pleasure, see them regarded also with pleasure.
Still, sex then was a taking, like spoils of war, a victory
over all those straight fucks back home, marooned
in the dismal suburbs that birthed us squalling and red
and watched us flee in ungrateful cars down night highways.
 
And God knows it felt good those nights.
I was ready, it was ready, to open and answer the call.
And take me down and roll me over, yes, and give
it to me—but why all this riding away afterward?
 
Where was everyone going
and why didn’t I get to ride along? Who knew at first
nothing had changed, just wanting the thrust and tug
and slam up against the headboard, I should say so,
but left still wanting more, wanting to leap
out of centuries’ shame and be something new,
not this old consolation of women for the powerless,
some kind of cosmic door prize awarded
just for showing up with a dick,
some proof to themselves these boys were men.
 
“You’re good,” he said. Hell, I wasn’t taking a typing test,
I was fighting to live in a dying world.
I was throwing myself away, an offering to wildest space,
surrender to the mind’s dissolve, the body’s electric light,
nerve endings firing like exploding stars.
“You’re good,” they all said:
you’d think somebody was doing a survey.
Girls say yes to boys who say no, and then
your professor asks if you’re wearing underwear,
when you meet for your conference on the poetry of Yeats.
 
Crossing the border after midnight in a borrowed car
after a visit to the after-hours doctor’s office in Sarnia.
Nodding out in the back seat, pills wearing off.
He was a legend among undergraduates:
cheap and reliable, always on call,
until a month later the headlines screamed
“Abortion Doc!” when a girl died in his office
and he dragged her down to the river
and dumped her body in the underbrush.

Heart, oh heart,
I sit here writing your name
on pieces of paper,
folded, hidden, misplaced . . .
found again.
 
There is the element of saying
and there is the element of making:
one needn’t choose.
I am singing the dream out from the ice,
asking it to carry me
like a horse or a river, down and away.
 
This day, here in paned-glass sun:
the young waitress shaking out her apron
and retying it flat across her stomach—
a bit of vanity—her hair swept off her neck,
crash of a milk bottle
on the granite counter, cream
spread in a mild pool toward the rim,
and the roots of habit and longing
briefly seized by the mind.
 
So noisy here! The sound echoes
out of years, brought to this
showing forth, unrehearsed.
It seems we wake
and find ourselves repeating,
embodying the ancient gestures
by which we recognize
ourselves completed.
 
Not one of us could be born
and invent life—it must show through us—
the arm flung in the air, the coffee poured out,
and down the street, someone hurrying by,
head down against the wind.
 
And a man and a woman
come to an old grief,
carved in them, carved
into them
—the old way of water wearing rock—
by law, and the hatred
between them is equal
to the hope neither will release.
 
Each wants to be whole,
to embody all of time, when nothing
in this world is whole, and
this is by law.
 
When my father said bitterly
to my mother: you have changed,
he meant, without meaning to say,
how she had changed him. A man
holds his head down against the wind.
Yet the wind fills him
with the dust of temples,
the breath of the dead.
 
The dream of the light
inside the branches—
a gleam of wet, glimmer that is a bud,
the leaf within the bud.
 
The photographer comes inside
and closes the lens of his camera.
Then he is the lens. Then my eye
is the light. This
is the element of saying.
The young waitress flings a paper cup
behind her, into the trash can.
That is a saying. The cream swirled
into the coffee, the sugar
dissolving, disembodied,
and the body of the manager disappears,
swallowed into a doorway.
 
The element of making is slow,
uncertain as a temple,
a falling forward, stitching back,
like a stone wall, like the panes in an
arched window, like a repetition
chosen beyond necessity.
 
Yet somehow we have seen all this before—
the girl in the fur hat
speaking syrup into a phone;
the falseness of her charm
is an ancient imposter, familiar and
therefore true.
A door is opened and falls
closed. Suddenly at every table
someone looks down and is reading—
books, newspapers, calendars,
reading tea leaves, reading bones.
 
A woman in a periwinkle jacket: I am reading
her shoulders as the day introspects.
In dream the passive construction
and the past perfect tense prevail:she was being pushed on a swing.
The woman with many television credits
gazes out the window, heavy with years,
forgetting herself, forgetting sorrow,
the false husband, the crippled child,
the old plots forgetting, 
and it is suddenly lovely, as free as
something read or dreamed; the young
waitress with sun on her
face—her unblemished face—looks up,
from the middle of eternity, her desire
immaculate in the moment. 
When a word is beautiful
above all others—your name—
when a woman appears as a bird of prey
and we turn away,
hoping not to be recognized—oh heart!—
 
when the light on the branches
flares in a window with no sky,
this is old story reading us, these are springs
from words laid down before
and ahead of us, and in the moment
we are making an answer.

It’s September: I’ve moved into town,
into the attic of an old barn—a big open room I reach
by climbing a ladder that rises through a hole in the floor.
The room is long and high, with windows at each end,
a row of skylights that leak rain, and shake
and chatter in the northeast winds. I sleep beneath
the roof’s steep pitch, my mattress flat on the boards,
looking up at the high ceiling, where morning
diffuses downward in grains of bright dust. 
This was the old painter’s studio.
The light in those famous canvases is still here
—he couldn’t carry it away with him—
though his paintings took away everything else,
opening space with a stroke of blue or yellow.
I think of his violent loves, the stories
they still tell about him here.
But how quiet and alive his paintings were,
how they quiver with the life not yet realized. 
The town is quiet in September.
Sometimes I hear people talking in the street.
Last night someone said they were going to wait for Michael,
and a voice said that Michael had gone home.
I walk the narrow path down to the marsh.
Wind hard in the dunes. Rain as I’m returning,
cutting through twisting streets, past gardens bent
low with rain, their colors a wash of gold. 
I feel the air surround my body, feel it move
between my legs and between each finger,
as I walk, not mastering space, but in it.
And when the clouds open, the sky
suddenly wide and high, no roof of leaves,
it seems there’s nowhere to go but into wind or water.
I climb the narrow stairs that keep turning,
twisting inward until they meet the ceiling,
which opens and I rise through the floor,
released into an openness I never learn to expect. 
At the yellow table I sit and read
an interview with Picasso’s lover, Francoise Gilot,
the only one to leave him and have another life.
She says she was not destroyed by him, as the others were:
“Because I am of the stuff that cannot be destroyed.”
I felt something blow through me then.
Some devouring wind. Surely, then,
I am of the stuff that can be destroyed.
Haven’t I felt it? The breaking of all I was?
Don’t I sit and count my losses,
here in this room where all the life I knew has ended,
so bare with desire I seem to be eating sky? 
That’s how it is here: I’m lonely, sad;
the wind blows along the roof and I can’t sleep.
Rain runs down the walls and streams across the floor,
leaving dirty puddles on the boards.
A yellow table and a cupboard painted blue,
three chairs that don't match, or even balance rightly,
a dented bucket, its metal reflecting darkly
what is, what cannot be taken away.
What’s beautiful here? The whole thing
is beauty, a clarity not in things
but around them, complete. And still, 
I seem to remain, somehow, myself,
to remain at least something, at a loss
to know how much can be taken from me
and leave me only changed, not ruined,
alert in an emptiness so alive
I recognized it as my life. What would be left,
the shape of it then, this life? I said some beauty,
or radiance, an endless space I fall into
or am taken up by, a brightness that holds me,
gathers light in the center of empty space,
like a vision of the life I have not lived.

The Arizona highway sailed across the desert—
     a gray battleship drawing a black wake,
            halting at the foot of the orange mesa,
                  unwilling to go around.
Hopi men and women—brown, and small, and claylike
      —peered down from their tabletops at yellow tractors, water trucks,
            and white men blistered with sun—red as fire ants—towing
                  sunscreen-slathered wives in glinting Airstream trailers
                         in caravans behind them.
Elders knew these bia roads were bad medicine—knew too
     that young men listen less and less, and these young Hopi men
           needed work, hence set aside their tools, blocks of cottonwood root
                 and half-finished Koshari the clown katsinas, then
                        signed on with the Department of Transportation,
were hired to stab drills deep into the earth’s thick red flesh
     on First Mesa, drive giant sparking blades across the mesas’ faces,
           run the drill bits so deep they smoked, bearding all the Hopi men
                 in white—Bad spirits, said the Elders—
The blades caught fire, burned out—Ma’saw is angry, the Elders said.
     New blades were flown in by helicopter. While Elders dreamed
            their arms and legs had been cleaved off and their torsos were flung
                  over the edge of a dinner table, the young Hopi men went
                         back to work cutting the land into large chunks of rust.
Nobody noticed at first—not the white workers,
     not the Indian workers—but in the mounds of dismantled mesa,
           among the clods and piles of sand,
                 lay the small gray bowls of babies’ skulls.
Not until they climbed to the bottom did they see
     the silvered bones glinting from the freshly sliced dirt-and-rock wall—
           a mausoleum mosaic, a sick tapestry: the tiny remains
                 roused from death’s dusty cradle, cut in half, cracked,
                        wrapped in time-tattered scraps of blankets.Let’s call it a day, the white foreman said.
     That night, all the Indian workers got sad-drunk—got sick
          —while Elders sank to their kivas in prayer. Next morning,
                as dawn festered on the horizon, state workers scaled the mesas,
                        knocked at the doors of pueblos that had them, hollered
                               into those without them,
demanding the Hopi men come back to work—then begging them—

When my brother died
I worried there wasn’t enough time
to deliver the one hundred invitations
I’d scribbled while on the phone with the mortuary:Because of the short notice no need to rsvp.
Unfortunately the firemen couldn’t come.
(I had hoped they’d give free rides on the truck.)
They did agree to drive by the house once
with the lights on— It was a party after all.
I put Mom and Dad in charge of balloons,
let them blow as many years of my brother’s name,
jails, twenty-dollar bills, midnight phone calls,
fistfights, and er visits as they could let go of.
The scarlet balloons zigzagged along the ceiling
like they’d been filled with helium. Mom blew up
so many that she fell asleep. She slept for ten years—
she missed the whole party.
My brothers and sisters were giddy, shredding
his stained T-shirts and raggedy pants, throwing them up
into the air like confetti.
When the clowns came in a few balloons slipped out
the front door. They seemed to know where
they were going and shrank to a fistful of red grins
at the end of our cul-de-sac. The clowns played toy bugles
until the air was scented with rotten raspberries.
They pulled scarves from Mom’s ear—she slept through it.
I baked my brother’s favorite cake (chocolate, white frosting).
When I counted there were ninety-nine of us in the kitchen.
We all stuck our fingers in the mixing bowl.
A few stray dogs came to the window.
I heard their stomachs and mouths growling
over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom.
(There was no room in the hallway because of the magician.)
The mariachis complained about the bathtub acoustics.
I told the dogs, No more cake here, and shut the window.
The fire truck came by with the sirens on. The dogs ran away.
I sliced the cake into ninety-nine pieces.
I wrapped all the electronic equipment in the house,
taped pink bows and glittery ribbons to them—
remote controls, the Polaroid, stereo, Shop-Vac,
even the motor to Dad’s work truck—everything
my brother had taken apart and put back together
doing his crystal meth tricks—he’d always been
a magician of sorts.
Two mutants came to the door.
One looked almost human. They wanted
to know if my brother had willed them the pots
and pans and spoons stacked in his basement bedroom.
They said they missed my brother’s cooking and did we
have any cake. No more cake here, I told them.Well, what’s in the piñata? they asked. I told them
God was and they ran into the desert, barefoot.
I gave Dad his slice and put Mom’s in the freezer.
I brought up the pots and pans and spoons
(really, my brother was a horrible cook), banged them
together like a New Year’s Day celebration.
My brother finally showed up asking why
he hadn’t been invited and who baked the cake.
He told me I shouldn’t smile, that this whole party was shit
because I’d imagined it all. The worst part he said was
he was still alive. The worst part he said was
he wasn’t even dead. I think he’s right, but maybe
the worst part is that I’m still imagining the party, maybe
the worst part is that I can still taste the cake.

Purportedly a chain of civilians, soldiers, voices
lice they were called. It is sometimes sufficient to beg
Lice creeping over one, kill them with a chemical;
then there are lice-ghosts everywhere. Glints of pearly
nails. The light of my beloved will keep me from noticing.
Trailer to keep her in; he asked me if I knew her ‘auction name.’
Walked over the scorch; what are values when there’s nothing here?
The wing of a dead soul grows into all the lace you see through,
foreigner, lice-ridden article of divestment. Splendid vices
pouring outcomes over the eager cash flow promotions.
So many of the dead came to me that their transparencies
covered my visage, I’m too near you. Don’t you want to see? 
We came from faraway camps, forsaking the human because it
broke our bodies into pieces for the torturer’s pet, who
propositions you. There is always a slant on it. The trees must 
go down; or light affects your eyes badly. We pleaded for an
adjustment, before we’d recognizably died. You
told me you were a heart, but you were guarding a tower. You
said you were a failure, but you helped destroy us.
Wings all over me, stuck to my skin, there’s no point to it
why are you here when there’s nothing? We just don’t believe it.Now not no never you. I wasn’t you. You have to talk to me
my name is irretrievable. No one letting you go because you
are prized for not existing except as a body, now not.
No I don’t exist, alighting and ghoulishly begging you for a
drop of your blood, a morsel of your flesh. Yes take some of
me, though there are so many others with flesh. But they’re too
rich to give. I know they will never let you in, you beautiful
kids who haunt the corridors extending through
the invisible world, so you can find your way. So you can see
past the smoke of disastrous fear acting out of dreams:
it creeps everywhere. See how it took them over, for
they had no mind to stand against any fantasy the instigators
chose. Had no minds at all. When I was little, no one told
me I’d have to suffer. Who can be a child? And the ghoul
patiently explains how the wing of a word can extend till the
barrier is made, so they can’t see us. If you say beauty, that
will be ignored, and we can hide. It was his name a long time ago,
before the auctions began. Her face then was large and younger.
She can be lice or ghoul. I want that, I don’t want action. But I
will have to live off bits of you.The new definition of witch is one who lets them eat you, if they have to. Because you keep regenerating. Oh that’s such an oldy, and all that flying. Sometimes they do—the man who showed me a few things sits all day. The teaching is to let them come as far as inside you even, empty enough; I can hear them and render affection Why, if there’s nothing? Is this nothing? But you are destroyed We shake all the time. You remind me of someone else I knew. The wing is inscribed, forinvolute. Not to beg in the offering of primal services, we have come here. No one would let us tell anything but our bodily humiliations; had to do differently, not for redemption, because we are more than redemption. I am my maker. The shape formed by the bits of mirror glued on is unimportant. They’re inside my chest and stomach, and they glitter in there. Then if light disattaches, comes up to be spoken, you can see and you can hear. This is true because each of you has this too. Has all the bright pieces inside: there was nothing else left to be. Then I say it, like these pages, or how they would love me for hosting them. The earliest people feared them, and subsequent ones deny the dead. Why would I be afraid of all the people dead and martyred? I thought you were talking about words. You knew I wasn’t.Dido who had to be delivered from the wrong story:I want you to know I’m no longer left over. What about ourlibrary, nothing good left there? I want to read the fashion of when youwere old a long time ago. Gothic roses in the type; I’m an ancientHad read every the book of before they arrested me.I had crossed the black plain, I had held tears it was abruptto be walked in a herd pushing us, wherever we went to be shot, orexecuted in the earlier style. It is a timeless death placed next to themost beat-up books. Only a book can love me now. We’re readingwithout real eyes; I’ve read everything too, or in the tradition oftelling it is repeated within you what we did. We must havebeen trying to make something as we are now, but why. Youhave the ear for it. The light wants you to reply, asking if ashore had been attained or if the language were Dutch or SwahiliI didn’t know. It is how you raised the ground, like raising a childevery word that comes out of my mouth torn I’m responsible toThe wind foul pieces here tries to turn me from tenderness, the waythey killed us in the center of the city, that night.

Treason said the ghoul thatpeculiar invention betrayal, how primal was that?In Hesiod after the light, after chaos and lover. Said the armlesswoman, said the one cut open, said the smallpoxedthe strewn children their bodies woven into the pageso I could find what they thought, even if babies only cry.Those are the bodies when I was no longer alive but upliftedbutterfly of lace with an empty length to bifurcate my symmetry.No I don’t believe the lies of the live. I am a spot of light inorder to find out, hanging on because it wasn’t revealed indeath. I know what happened to me, she said; bleeding Ilay there unblessed. Do I want a blessing now, or a god torebuild me? We have gone beyond god or new lives, or death, ortribes. I am working on this lace light at present; I accept thedrop of sacrificial blood to propitiate me. One piece of you at a timeis all I need. I am letting you feed, I say, because I know this hasalways been. You’ve been telling me for yearsWe needed you, if no one else did.

How lovely it is not to go. To suddenly take ill.
Not seriously ill, just a little under the weather.
To feel slightly peaked, indisposed. Plagued by
a vague ache, or a slight inexplicable chill.
Perhaps such pleasures are denied
to those who never feel obliged. If there are such.
How pleasant to convey your regrets. To feel sincerely
sorry, but secretly pleased to send them on their way
without you. To entrust your good wishes to others.
To spare the equivocal its inevitable rise.
How nice not to hope that something will happen,
but to lie on the couch with a book, hoping that
nothing will. To hear the wood creak and to think.
It is lovely to stay without wanting to leave.
How delicious not to care how you look,
clean and uncombed in the sheets. To sip
brisk mineral water, to take small bites
off crisp Saltines. To leave some on the plate.
To fear no repercussions. Nor dodge
the unkind person you bug.
Even the caretaker has gone to the party.
If you want something you will have to
get it yourself. The blue of the room seduces.
The cars of the occupied sound the wet road.
You indulge in a moment of sadness, make
a frown at the notion you won't be missed.
This is what it is. You have opted to be
forgotten so that your thoughts might live.

In the dark evening, my father and I
walk down the road to the old house

lifted up, tired, on a footstool,
still in her thick stockings,
the feet with legs and stockings
looking just like Grandma's
after bearing nine children who lived,
standing, working all day,
the kind of woman who made stacks of toast, platters of eggs
for all of us each hot morning,
did laundry, then lunch,
supper, and worked with the animals

the rest of the day.

so many times in the past, remembering
not to slam the screen, as everyone would yell
although I am now also older and finite,
the seams of myself coming apart.
How I wish I could go to that woman
with her legs up and rub her feet,
put liniment on her legs.
Years have passed through the doors
of that house, of memory, doors of the past
and my father's eyes
are sad, looking in,
his own memories, not mine,
thinking maybe of his mother
and some of his old belongings,
the stolen Colt of his own father,
the bracelet he gave me with his R.A. number.
Her memories are unremembered,
as my grandfather's,
as those before them,

our many losses.

September is work to the center
Of arguments and controversies.
Prejudgments and incomprehensions.
What will I love if not that
That was enigma?
The years of infancy, Memory says,
And there we are, with the demon
Of the art of living
Traced on the glass of some window.
In the beauty of the night of May,
Clear of moon, to the lume of a candle
There was a design like the profile
Of a landscape almost abandoned. Gone
But not gone yet. It's fascinating,
These mysterious uncovered feelings.
Enigma of an afternoon of autumn, the picture
Of which is a composition
Of the eye of my mind. Every hour
That I watch this picture
I see again still that moment.
Nevertheless the moment is an enigma
For me, in how much is inexplicable.
The physical things hide in the architecture
Of the event. The enigma of a mock-up,
Of a shadow, the spectral and eternal aspect
Of the moment. Praises to you for being
One great box of surprise,
Your head the scene of a wonderful theater
Of the most tender gray of the fog
That joins the sky to the earth.
A tangling of truth and memory,
Mythology and iconography,
I watch with the eye
Of the mind the city that accommodates
That one beautiful day that is now infinite.
It deepens. It begins. The cyclical method.
Memory is deeply not alive; it's a mock-up
And this renders it hateful. Yet, it is not a fiction,
Is a truth, indeed a sad and monstrous truth.
I was assigned to you, together we were
A beautiful and melancholic picture.
This last picture is the realization
Of the overwhelming moment
In which the acute eye perceives you as a now
That is over. A now that is fixed
In the swept past.

This bald year, frozen now in February.
This cold day winging over the ugly
Imperfect horizon line,
So often a teeth line of ten buildings.
A red flag flapping
In the wind. An orange curtain is noon.
It all hurts her eyes. This curtain is so bright.
Here is what is noticeably true: sight.
The face that looks back from the side
Of the butter knife.
A torn-bread awkwardness.
The mind makes its daily pilgrimage
Through riff-raff moments. Then,
Back into the caprice case to dream
In a circle, a pony goes round.
The circle's association: There's a center
To almost everything but never
Any certainty. Nothing is
More malleable than a moment. We were
Only yesterday breathing in a sea.
Some summer sun
Asked us over and over we went. The sand was hot.
We were only yesterday tender hearted
Waiting. To be something.
A spring. And then someone says, Sit down,
We have a heart for you to forget. A mind to suffer
With. So, experience. So, the circus tent.
You, over there, you be the girl
In red sequins on the front of a card selling love.
You, over there, you, in black satin.
You be the Maiden's Mister Death.

I'm remembering again, the day
we stood on the porch and you smoked
while the old man told you
about his basement full of wine,
his bad heart and the doctor's warning,
how he held the dusty bottle out to you,
glad, he said, to give it away
to someone who appreciated
its value and spirit, the years
it took to settle into its richness
and worth. I'm watching again,
each cell alive, as you reach
for the wine, your forearm exposed
below the rolled sleeve, the fine hairs
that sweep along the muscle, glowing,
lifting a little in the afternoon breeze.
I'm memorizing the shape of the moment:
your hand and the small bones
lengthening beneath the skin
as it tightens in the gripping,
in the receiving of the gift, the exact
texture and color of your skin,
and the old man's face, reduced
to its essence. That,
and the brief second
when both of you had a hand on the bottle—
the thing not yet given,
not yet taken, but held
between you, stoppered, full.
And my body is flooded again
with an elemental joy,
holding onto it against another day
in the unknowable future when I'm given
terrible news, some dark burden
I'll be forced to carry. I know
this is useless, and can't possibly work,
but I'm saving that moment, for balance.

She's sipping rum punch from a martini glass;
her whole body appears to be smiling, glowing,

I know she doesn't drink, hasn't in decades,

a  few  times  each day to understand your father's sky, as you take it apart
piece  by  piece  and can't feel  anything,  can't  feel the tree growing under
your feet, the eyes poking night only to find another night to compare it to.
Whoever   heard   of   turning   pain   into   hummingbirds   or   red  birds—
haven't  we  grown?  What  does  it mean to be older?  Maybe a house with-
out  doors  can  still  survive  a  storm. Maybe I can't find the proper way to
rebel  or  damn it,  I can't  leave.  I want to,  but you grow inside of me. And
as  I  watch   you,  before  I  know  it,  I'm  too  heavy,  too full  of  you  to  move.
Maybe  that's what they meant when they said you shouldn't love a country
too much.

When G died began the midnight panic attacks.
He spoke French and English
but that didn't help.
How the body can betray.
It frayed and decayed and then

If you believe in snow, you have to believe
in water as it's meant to be, loosed
from clouds arranged like asphodel. Because that's
what it's like to come back: a slow
surfacing, memory spiraling away. You can sleep

sleep like water, love your heavy limbs
pushing river and ocean aside.

bracelets of semiprecious beads, and she
couldn't stop counting the kinds of blue.
Here, summer, in the high shade of a ginko,
she pulls up a handful of stones on silk
and we drink grapefruit seltzer, listening
to the tinny chime of bubbles
rising to the air. She can't remember
autumn, so we tell her someday this tree will drop
its fan-shaped leaves all at once,
golden in the October crush
of every plant's frantic strip show. Later
we'll see mountains through the scrim of empty
branches, and if we can look straight up
into the atmosphere, see the same plain old sky
revolving. When we ask Maggie what color it is
she always says iolite, picturing beads
like raindrops, shining azure on the table.
She forgets that sometimes things don't stay
where you leave them, that the sky fades
to white even before snow begins
to fall. It's hard, but we have to tell her
even sapphires don't glow blue
without some kind of help.

                ","
Inside the night, this hospital, asylum,
this party for those undone by desire, forever
unslaked, inside a house inside the night,
I'm inside
this house with eight beams and moonlight
pulling on the past through skylights, this house
of white noise, wind and dry heat, lonely
house on a ridge line, house of ordinary
shame,
my sister's house with corrals and outbuildings
around it, and beyond that, the dog
patrolling, and beyond that, skirts and folds
of the mountain rising in rumpled geologic
scrolls into the range.
At the center
beneath the moon's silence that nothing
ever changes, muffled in blankets with fear
beside me on my little bench of sleep,
I can hear their voices,
could be three or twenty-three,
unhinged saints gabbling to their shadows,
or panty-sniffers, drug-trippers in all flavors
past vanilla, could be Birnam wood
on the move, the shriek of its roots thirsty
and air-brushed, or a pack of lunatics
crooning norteño songs.
What is certain is advent.
They're coming down,
                             coming towards
the heart beneath the feathers,
coming for
what can't be protected,
on a beam of dread,
riding that ray.
I'm listening, my eyes snapped-open
inside darkness, other people in other rooms
who know how to sleep through a night
like this night, thrown against the roundness
of the world which is desire.
The old bitch guards this night on the ranch,
half shepherd, half other, this is her watch,
she gallops the perimeter, anxious to sound like
more than one dog, though she's going arthritic
and her paws strike the hard ground.
Now they quiet, penitents, lunatics,
marauders and ragpickers, quiet.
Only one left behind and the moon
                           is his hieroglyph,
one creature padding
                down the mountain,
coming closer.
Coyote knows a good joke,
he only wants to let her in on it.
He can't stop laughing, can't stop
crying, can't stop licking the crevices
clean, licking safety and duty
until they're empty.
I hear the dog listening, ears lifted.
Coyote's tongue slides into night
air, pressing narcotic vowels throughwonder, through longing
and longing and wonder awaken. She's close
to that edge, that border in the night
where one thing becomes another and even
an old dog who's worked a ranch eleven years
feels the urge to let loose, blow this little
settlement, go wild.
Clouds loose and blue in the arms
of the moon, slant light on this mountain raking
us, the dog and I, we feel the pull. Imagine
a woman trying to come between
coyote and the female he's after
when she knows
what is dark and offers itself and vanishes
has come for her at last? The body wants
what it can't have, to follow the path
of thirst through the rent in the wire
beyond the corral.
The dog doesn't move, but who knows
better than she the small outpost
death has set up in her, maybe she's all
desire now to slip under the moon
and chase down that lure.
Coyote wheedles and croons another minute
or two, then lopes off, calling over his shoulder
in a language even I can understand,
the right names for thingsnot kept in heaven.

When I learned I could own a piece of The World
I got my chequebook out. Eternal life belongs to those
who live in the present. My wife's bright eye affirmed it.
As do the soothing neutral tones and classic-contemporary
decor of our professionally designed apartments,
private verandahs before which the globe, endlessly
and effortlessly circumnavigated, slips by, allowing residents
no end of exotic ports, a new destination every few days
to explore with a depth we hadn't thought possible.
It's not how things are on The World that is mystical,
not the market and deli, proximity of masseuse
and sommelier, not the gym, our favourite restaurant,
our other favourite restaurant, the yacht club, the library,
the golf pro, the pool, but that it exists at all, a limited
whole, a logic and a feeling. What looks like freedom
is, in fact, the perfection of a plan, and property
a stocktaking laid against us in a measure. The difference
between a thing thought, and done. One can ignore neither
the practical applications nor the philosophical significance
of our onboard jewelry emporium, its $12 million inventory,
natural yellow diamonds from South Africa no one needs,
thus satisfying the criteria for beauty. Without which
there is no life of the mind. What we share, though, transcends
ownership, our self-improvement guaranteed
by the itineraries, licensed experts who prepare us
for each new harbour and beyond, deliver us into the hands
of native companions on The World's perpetual course.
The visual field has no limits. And the eye—
the eye devours. Polar bears, musk oxen, rare thick-billed
murre. We golfed on the tundra and from The World
were airlifted to pristine snowfields, clifftops where we dined
alfresco above frozen seas. The World is the entirety.
The largest ship ever to traverse the Northwest Passage.
How the silent energy coursed between us. Fundamental rules
had changed. Except, with time, it seems a sort of accident—
natural objects combined in states of affairs, their internal properties. Accusatory randomness and proliferation
of types, brutal quantity literally brought to our doors.
Or past them, as if on the OLED high-def screen
of our circumstances, which hides more than it reveals.
For what we see could be other than it is.
Whatever we're able to describe at all could be other
than it is. Such assaults on our finer feelings require an appeal
to order, to the exercise of discipline a private Jacuzzi represents,
from which one might peacefully enjoy the singular euphoria
of the Panama Canal or long-awaited departure
from fetid Venice. There is some truth in solipsism, but I fear
I'm doing it wrong, standing at the rail for ceremonial cast-offs
thunderously accessorized with Vangelis or ""Non, je ne regrette rien,""
made irritable by appreciative comments about the light.
In Reykjavík or Cape Town, it's the same. Familiarity
without intimacy is the cost of privacy, security
of a thread count so extravagant its extent can no longer
be detected. Even at capacity, The World is eerily empty:
its crew of highly trained specialists in housekeeping,
maintenance, beauty, and cuisine—the heart and soul
of the endeavour—are largely unseen and likely where the fun is.
We sit at the captain's table but don't know him. He's Italian.
I think on my Clarksville boyhood long before EPS, ROE—
retractable clothesline sunk in concrete, modest backyard
a staging ground for potential we felt infinite to the degree
our parents knew it wasn't. The unknown is where we played.
And while fulfilment of a premeditated outcome
confers a nearly spiritual comfort of indifference
to the time of year, a paradise of fruits always in season,
the span of choice defines its limit, which cannot be exceeded.
The sea rolls over, props on an elbow, and now is heard
the small sound of a daydream running softly aground.
Dissatisfaction, in a Danish sense. On prevailing winds a scent
of compromise; for one tires of the spacewalk outside
what is the case. Beyond immediate luxuries
lives speculation and the tragic impression one is yet
to be born. It could be when all pursuits have been satisfied,
life's problems will remain untouched. But doubt exists only
where questions exist. The World satisfies its own conditions.
It argues for itself. Herein lies an answer.

I brought what I knew about the world to my daily life
and it failed me. I brought senseless accidents

Also I brought what I had learned of love,
an air of swift entrance and exit, a belief in trouble
and desire. It will amount to something
I was told, and I was told to hold fast to decency,
to be spotlit and confident. I was told
next year’s words await another voice.
But you are a hard mouth to speak to
and if I write the list it will be free of constancy.
It will include fierce birds, false springs,
a few oil lamps that need quickly to be lit.
Also dusk and weeds and a sleep that permits
utter oblivion from our stranded century.
This is not a natural world, and if there are
recoveries from confusion, they pass like rains.
I don’t look to the robins for solace; neither do I trust
that to make an end is to make a beginning.

both touch the quartet inside evening,
the snow inside the willow, the bewildering kinship

D always felt, somehow or other, double. He was an upright line, but then again, he was a curve. When he looked in the mirror straight on, he saw the dapper features of the diplomat he was. But sideways, if he took off his horn-rimmed glasses, he imagined he could be taken for a rather distinguished Dame. He always saw both sides to everything.
     Would he ever find his dæmon—the divine spirit within? Did he really have one spirit? D seemed to be singing a duet with himself.

The pain was a distinct tiny stab in a spot, well, what would you call that? D called it down there.
     For years, since he was a little d, he considered all the options about this strange pain. It was nothing, really. He went long times between feeling it. Maybe it was too slight to worry about, but then again . . . At last D decided to see a doctor. As a matter of fact, he saw a number.
     “Tell me your dreams,” the first doctor said.
     “Don't bother to ask me, I never dream,” D said.
     “In dreams begin responsibilities,” the doctor quoted.
     D demanded a referral.
     “I've got a very specific pain,” he said to the next doctor. He pointed to, well, down there.
      “Your testicle,” the physician said. Which required a test. Several. And more.
      Finally the second doctor read all the results and announced, “Aha, a dermoid cyst.” What? Inside the cyst were hair follicles and an eye-type thing with eyelashes and a tooth.
     “Do you think I was a twin?” D wondered with a weird kind of delight as he examined the x-ray.
     Well, the doctor wouldn’t go that far. These dermoid cysts were usually removed in childhood. No reason, however, to remove it now. D wouldn’t dream of having it removed! It explained everything! That slightly creepy darling little creature in there must have been a twin, someone D had grown around as she dissolved. D was convinced it was a twin sister.
     And D had absorbed her. Of course he wanted to keep her with him.
     That very day, he had his first dream.
     Exhausted after his discovery, he had returned to the embassy in the late afternoon. Unable to face his office, he diverted his steps from the front walk toward the deserted path on the grounds where no one ever seemed to stroll. He walked deeper into the woods. The path sloped into a shaded dimple in the earth.
     It was dusk in the dell.
     D heard the drone of insect wings. In the mottled light a dragonfly dove straight down. Up curved a damselfly.
     Impulsively D lay down in the leaves in his three-piece suit and curled up like a praying divine, two hands under his chin. He felt himself melting a little. All the old bedevilments dispersed into a delicate dampness. The world softened from darkling to darling . . . 
 
. . . A stately antlered stag appeared in the distance and slowly, with a calm command, walked closer until D could see that he wore a diamond necklace around his neck. The stag slowly bowed his head, doffed his entire rack of antlers, and raised his head up again, looking directly at D.     Now the deer was a doe! The doe blinked her eyes at D, as if waking. Then she donned the antlers, and turned and walked away . . .
 
D woke up ravenously hungry—and overjoyed.
     He dusted himself off and drove straight to dinner. As he stared out the restaurant window, eating his dumplings, he wondered if responsibilities really do begin in dreams.
     Maybe dreams are responsible to us, he thought.
     He felt his sister inside him. She was the reason he was a debonair man, a man who understood that everything has two sides: inner/outer, yes/no. D thought both in lines as sharp as the creases in trousers, and in curves like the swirls of a skirt.     What do I really know? he asked himself. Only that he had woken strangely endeared to himself—and satisfied. Now he understood the necessity of delay. To wait, and then to discover. Never to have only one answer.
     The napkin at the restaurant had come rolled inside a little sparkly ring. “Add this to my bill,” he said to the waiter. And pocketed the little diadem as a reminder of the dyad he was.

I wanted to write the story of a metamorphosis. The story
is at least partly based on a dream I recall from the diary of
another writer. In the dream, which may not be a dream but
simply a vision the writer has while seated at his desk, an
image of a white horse appears on the wall. It is a white horse
that haunts the writer's mind. The white horse has escaped
its traces somewhere on an urban street. It is moving toward
the suburbs with an eye to the countryside. It is successful in
this movement because it progresses without hurry. It does
not gallop. It moves along the street with the gait of a horse
that drags a heavy cart behind it. The horse moves successfully
toward its liberation since it does not appear to be a fugitive.
My heart beats more quickly when I think about this story,
which I have almost certainly partially invented. The horse
hides its fear of slaughter. It plays a game.
Irony is a kind of secrecy. It is a principle of groups.

So today, yet another Guyanese will try to run the border

since her disappearance in a downtown shopping mall.
An “incident,” the paper says. Another “routine occurrence”—
wresting my trust from the publicans
assigned to keeping us safe, whole. Rather:
vow to stay vigilant against the maiming
that waits in each landscape, even in this
mundane procession of muddy spring days. To see
the tenacity of rooted hair for what it is:
an illusion as fleeting as courage. To keep the meat
between one’s ribs from being torn, to keep the hard
marble of the cranium covered with its own skin.
To stay vigilant. To watch the signs of violence stirring
even in one's own machine. To keep both breasts
attached and undiseased. To keep the womb empty;
and yet to keep the organs living there
from shriveling like uneaten fruit, from turning
black and dropping. And not to mistake the danger
for a simple matter of whether
to put the body on the streets, of walking
or of staying home—; there are household cleansers
that can scar a woman deeper than a blade
or dumdum bullets. The kitchen drawers are full of tools
that lie unchaperoned. Even with the doors and windows
bolted, in the safety of my bed, I am haunted by the sound
of him (her, it, them) stalking the hallway,
his long tongue already primed with Pavlovian drool.
Or him waiting in the urine-soaked garages of this city's
leading department stores, waiting to deliver up the kiss
of a gunshot, the blunted kiss of a simple length of pipe.
But of course I mean a larger fear: the kiss
of amputation, the therapeutic kiss of cobalt.
The kiss of a deformed child. Of briefcase efficiency
and the forty-hour workweek. Of the tract home:
the kiss of automatic garage-door openers that
despite the dropped eyelid of their descent do nothing
to bar a terror needing no window for entry:
it resides within. And where do we turn for protection
from our selves? My mother, for example, recommends marriage—

else is. Bob, the neighbor.
My new paranoia.
I Google how to escape a car
filling with water. I watch videos
on YouTube. I memorize the steps

you take your seat belt off. Late at night,
I read pages and pages on the internet.
What if the car lands
in the water flipped over?
Remember to stay calm.

her minivan into the ocean on purpose.
Horrified beachgoers run toward the water.

One of the kids is screaming “No, mommy” —
What about the sunroof?
What if you land in the water
and your car has a sunroof?
My new car has a sunroof.
You have to let the car fill with water
so that pressure is equalized on both sides.
This is elementary physics.
If you don’t do this, it’s
impossible to open the doors.

You have to hold your breath.
None of the YouTube videos say anything

kids strapped in car seats in the car.

Water in dreams signifies turbulent emotions.
If you are in your car and there
is a flash flood, you should get out immediately.
Even six inches of water can sweep your car away.
Sweep it to where?

Our tragedy is we can’t see it.
We see by reflection. We need biofluorescence

distort, though. When gravity bends light, huge galaxy
clusters can act as telescopes, elongating background
images of star systems to faint arcs — a lensing effect
like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine.

no external radiance, this is the final struggle left to win,
this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest
begin, this the lens through which at last to see both Self

Gravel path stirred by the rain
fallen hard through the sweetgum trees,
path that leads to the bend
where the trail splits open in air:
Everything is lighted evenly.
It is a queer hour. The difference
between light and shadow
is the jealousy turn in the eye.
The sun is all in the bottle cap
that glints in the silt like a djinn’s brass hilt,
in the way some lea  is frozen unto the air,
some warm leaf heavywet here, and in how, just there:
The strangeness strangely passes.
And evening mounts.
I can’t get the life out of my head.
There is no glamour on this path
but if I return I will find it
in the thought of how I looked for some.
I stoop to look at the veins that sweep
like Latin roots in the satin of things, dream:
The difference between something and nothing,
which is nothing.
The gravel lies on itself like dust lies on water.
No, no, there are no mothers here.
I bend to see it all, the little stones cast-wise.
Things chase themselves away from the mode of things.
I find a quartz, milked clear:
I could not hear its accent if it sang,
no matter how far off it formed.
What dead hand I should feel if I lifted it.

This spirit she came upon me as I slept — in such a way
my life or yours could come to be so thoroughly owned — 
she was reckless — I knew she would make me run away
with her — I said spirit, slow down — but the spirit wanted
to ride — but I am so afraid, I said — I have all this tenderness
to impart — but the tenderness is not mine to give away — 
but all your tenderness is your own tenderness, said the spirit — 
it is not, I said — why then did you give it all away? — I did
not give it away — then it is yours to give away — the spirit
riddled like this — if in her arms I read a story — if out of her
arms I had the choice to write one but I chose not — chose not
because I did not know where I was going — because my path
broke down & I had this choice — stay or split — if I knew that
were I to split one part of me would become a ghost — if I did
not know yet which part — if the voice calling me out asked me
to describe the splitting & I did — if I said it was like smoke
spiraling outwards — it was like smoke lifting off me taking on
form & leaving me — if  it was like a delicate girl I never met
but dreamed of — if it was like the flags of my youth fluttering,
far out at sea — like breathing out a breath you will never take
back in — but you know you can never take any breath back in — 
if I saw her outside of myself & mourned her like I have mourned
no other loss — if I knew it was both a miracle & the most terrible
tragedy — to open up — release a flame — watch the flame go — 
have you seen it? A flame that can ride water — she was my
daughter & if I could I would send her to you, if I sent her to you
would you take her? Listen, I ran this out of me because I knew
it would burn me down — my trainers press the ground & lift up
again — I saw myself on my back in high grass in high summer
with everything coming to me — how this ghost left me & printed
a new person all over me — I could peel her off or live like this — 
I cried — one or both will destroy me! — the spirit called it fate but
I knew it was just drama — I will never know why a good person must die — 
fate does not exist I said, but every door I opened showed yesyes yes — I shut each one & locked it — checked the locks
three times — went back & checked them again — shook them to be
sure — drew hearts round the keyholes so the spirit would know
I loved her — it wasn’t — it was never — that I didn’t love her —

all the while it was going on. They became obsessed with
a fountain, for example, one they walked past each day,
how abundantly it would reach upwards and yet be pouring
back down itself the whole time — all winter this fountain
had been dry, not saying a word. What more can I tell you?

the evenings when the light was soft, anything bad sliding
off them, and they would feel owned, completely owned,
in a good way, by the air, which would touch them constantly,
sometimes urgently, sometimes lightly, just to let them know
it was there, and they would think maybe this is what being
alive is, when they saw how complicated a tree was and how
it wanted them looking at it and saying this, how the color
of a particular flower at this particular moment was redder
even than the life force, whatever that is, if you could open
it up and get right down inside it, if you could put your mouth
to it and become as red as that rose even, it was still redder
than that, and they wouldn’t know what to do with themselves
so they wouldn’t do anything except listen to the songs in their
heads which were sad ones like nearly all good songs and watch
this feeling rolling in, sunshine or rain, we don’t know yet,

ONE
The First Invention, ear laid to earth, is listening
to the fingerlength underground beings moving in segments
through tiny tunnels; one inch shrugs out another,
as bamboo climbs in segments, joint by green joint ...
Or an inexpressive mask that must travel
the world, uphill and down, always keeping its own
counsel, impelling  forward from inward—
unspelling a logic that cannot look out or see.
Or a thought that recurs, till one wonders
whether Bach’s theme, without cause, or pause,
is like a cat in a night-closet, the cat evenly leaping
from level to level; the theme that sinks down
into one hand, next leaps to the other, reprises itself,
then doubles down softly, a counterpane on a shelf.
SIX
Have you ever noticed, in Piranesi’s Carcerid’invenzione, the tiny repeating figures in the foreground?
Brittle, frugal, fugal, they ignore that above them
stairways rise out of sight, and somewhere else
collapse, in-swallowed, devolving through walls or domes.
The same way Bach’s motive splays out to the right,
swoons flatly, swans it, footnotes, follows up,
talks to itself, purls, mutters, dawdles, resumes ...
Six is playing at infancy, one three five,
that’s all Baby knows, a block pile clumsily building.
Then the tall chord falls sideways—pretends
it’s a melody—everyone knows it’s a chord—
or a problem in long division which at one point just sticks
on that endless, that déjà vu decimal, six six six ...
ELEVEN
Eleven is caterpillars, two, marching: the one
stave of thick-barred sixteenth notes set down
precisely beneath the other, tiptoe to toetip,
close-clinging, rising and falling and mirrored:
one looks down and locks the other’s horns,
or its own; the two could be said to be linked
like the locked yet endlessly out-spiraling
spindled ribbons of DNA. Yet there’s something
scary, like Cicero’s dizzying concept
of motus animi, hurtling mind unstoppably inventing
figures on figures, yet with no vanishing point,
a world of ladders or stairwells
where space keeps revolving, welling up into space
endless, unfree, unfolding like stairs in a case.

I can’t gunpoint when the life of this alter ego began though
the possibility can’t be dismissed it began at gunpoint in a way,
with an icy pressure against the temple, the mind splitting into two
tracks while a circus of peers clowned.Going back far too long
now, the camera has blurred my edges in the suggestion of motion
even if  I stood as still as the air does before shit really hits the fan.
I truly went ass-first into fronting indifference, forbade my happy
teeth from public reveal lest they pop the balloon of my perfectly
round face, baby-angled, already read as kind or innocent or soft
from the jump when I wanted respect on my name and women on
my lap like it was said I should. And, shamefully, I did. Several
sistas come to mind here and this doesn’t make me feel good;
a tender touch in the moonlight goes only so far for a shadow.
I had to break it down for myself that being down represented
the fear of having fear.I still shake when the wind blows,
scary as ever, thespian as always in all ways toward the ghost
of a threat or disrespect passed through me then through me,
through a thin skin then through the skin. So, to compensate—
a mask, what Dunbar’s bars beat home way back when about
standing in the presence of the pale folks, only that idea flipped
upside down, what’d be a forced smile slicing the face open like
some summertime melon instead setting scowl folds into smooth
forehead, brown eyes set at the mouth’s corners, fixing it in the
position of silence like rusty nails.If carrying nothing else,
I learned to bring this exact look to the danger because being me
to the fullest would be a liability, provide a sharper image for the
hidden cameras to home in on; yes, just that fast—a certified blue,
strolling up to the screen door with a heavy hand for knocking and
his true hand resting so sweetly on his gun. My gun, I should say,
since in this case the cop is also me, like that little angel or devil
used as sitcom trope.Just imagine the person coming for you

So what. Give up that so what.

The blood of language moves through the word cell from monk’s cell to prison cell to biological cell. I don’t know why a Braille cell is called a cell. I don’t know how many blood cells Louis Braille lost when the awl he was  playing with as a small child slipped and injured his eye.
Red blood cells live some hundred days before they are worn out by their silent hustle—looping and looping, pounded through the heart’s chambered cathedral, rushing out to the farthest reaches of the body with the good news of oxygen, squeezing single file along capillaries, like anxious deer probing their tracks through the woods. Rushing, silent, looping the circuits of the body. Again, again, again. Load iron. Dump iron. Load dump squeeze hustle.
Red blood cells pushed through the capillaries that pushed through my  retinas. They broke loose to run a green swarm in the corral of my eye. But that is history. Today cells still push through the capillaries fenced off by my calloused fingerprint. This one that I run over the Braille cell, the pattern of bumps.
—
A red blood cell is measured in microns. A solitary prison cell is measured in feet. Six feet by nine feet or less. I don’t know what the unit of measure is for how living in solitary changes a person. We know that living in a confined space, without access to the long view or landscape, changes the eye. The eye, for lack of practice, loses its ability to make out what lies in the distance. I don’t have a unit of measure for what this does to the heart.
—
A Braille cell is measured in spaces in a grid—two across by three down—that can be filled with a raised dot or bump. Different combinations of dots represent different letters, punctuation, symbols, shorthand.
—
The oldest cell I find in the dictionary is the monastic cell, a place for contemplation. From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions. Touching my reading educates me on my exact location in the world, feet in shoes, weight of foot on ground, weight of bones and flesh in chair.

In one segment of the landscape, a hyena drags her clitoris
across the plains, a dust perfuming up. Cicadas pulse the segment,
a femur filled with rain. It is a lush grassland within which
the greens have sprouted through the exposed joints of animals.
This seems to be a metaphor for growth and resistance. A
single singed dollar rolls through the wind. I read
a book that imagines, among other things, a world without
trees. I wrote a book that imagines, among other things, a world
without men. The book splayed open on my parents’ dresser,
an early part of the book. People do this when they no longer
want to see information. I no longer want to see information.
In another segment, a series of weasel oil candles, such is
the cure-all in this aspect of land. Mostly the candles are not
lit. At night the moon makes the earth shine like bottle
flies, a glimmer here and there where a lachrymose flame
continues on. A god peeks past the clit of the hyena
disapprovingly, as evidenced by their glare and nod. But I
want a god to glare and nod. I want a god to do anything at all
with my debts. In another segment, my grandmother
lives and she watches a pack of lionesses feasting inside
the rib cage of a zebra. At first, she tells us, she believes
the zebra to be sleeping on her side, but the lions move
her skin under the membrane of bones.

death we get and we are so very fond of the evenings.

been pushed out of their homeland by its persecutions, pulled into

my own kind to institutions with routine and rarely second thoughts

so expansively. And less than two nights later we’re all throwing our
asses in a circle, cuttin’ up, working up what was an effortless sweat,
undeterred even as the music skipped on every hiccup of the fraying
wires, tethered just as strenuously to joy as ever, like always, trying
to catch a good breath, but I paid it no mind, no mind, no mind—no,
I wasn’t absent upstairs exactly, I was hyper-present; what a ghost is
to death I was to life, inside everything simultaneously—the sub and
the synth, the blown-off roof and hole-stomped floor, the rise of
their chests and the fall—and only nigga returned me to this plane:my nigga, my nigga, a lyric left on my bottom lip like the sweet after-
burn of Hennessy, but yo, it’s like I was being called for, called out
of need since I know that word only has such resonance in a world
where we ain’t free. And, nah, we ain’t free, if you were wondering.
There are no shackles on me your eyes can see but none that I can’t
feel as if they were appendages divided from me by the occurrence

bring me, even at my most upright, to my knees. And if it happens—

immersed in the mess they’ve made that I’m tasked with cleaning
up for the commendation of pennies. I hope I don’t get shot while
genuflect since that’s apparently a thing now in this country, but I
worry such a selfish ask won’t have sufficient fuel to reach heaven,
that the bastardized sparrow will burn up in the atmosphere as easily
as tissue paper. And I recognize I’m rambling now, but I’m likewise
increasing my odds of bumping into the point of all this since inside
the milk of me something was stirred by what she said, but it’s hard
to translate a muscular language to a verbal one just as it’s hard to
relate to folk who don’t consider their own demise fifty ’leven times
a day at least, and for that relapse not to be an injurious ideation but
an itch of practicality. What I wouldn’t pay for the chance to not pay
attention to every little thing—how they talk near me and how they
talk when they believe I’m nowhere near, what they do or don’t do
with each other that they do or don’t do with me, the questions they
feel quite content to ask me and the ones they never seem to though
I leave the door open, the window, the bleeding heart. I know them
so well, people who wouldn’t know me from the next in the lineup;
I know them so intimately you’d think I love them all, and the gag is
that I do, by some undesired miracle, and that is part of all this, too.
To say they don’t deserve my time is an obvious statement, but they
take it anyway because it’s all they know, evident as I recount every
transgression taking seconds off my time on this earth, summing up
to years, almost to the point I’m gone already, in response to which
I either swallow spit or spit out ellipses. Ask the wounded wall what
I know of restraint, the manifesto I’d pen with what pours out from
my punctured knuckles, though, perhaps, the poet was signaling that,
all along, I’ve been teaching the most important life lesson merely by
domesticating rage, confining it inside the margins of the flesh that
my parents made for me, the page my life is written against each day
in corrective red ink. And this seems like the appropriate moment
to divulge that her sermon came during a dialogue about poetic craft
of all things, but if poetry can’t be applied to how one moves through
this world then I see very little worth in it, which is where it started
for me. Poetry was a dead white thing in my life once, at the bottom
of the trash can with the doll of Jesus they’d tried pawning off on me
back in Catholic school, but luckily I already knew one for us, by us,
and thus found the inner-strength to soldier through the barren winter
of lyrical delight rocking a pair of big-ass Timberlands and other on-
trend threads a person of greater gravitas could’ve filled out better
around the shoulders. But I digress—since what I really mean to be
speaking on is how the Cavalier poets weren’t really doing it for me
during high school, not because their explicit sexuality or their taste
for material excess and ambitious proximity to the throne were such
disagreeable subjects to me, at the time revisiting rap’s mafioso era,
but because when we painted those same pictures as we preferred to,
our tongues spiraling like ballerinas and bullets, they sought the ban
on sale or talked down on it as being absent of any artistic merit, as if
a nation’s worth of people surviving subjugation is more science than
art anyway, for if that were true, then we wouldn’t have a culture and
America wouldn’t have great product to push to the rest of the planet
aside from all the bombs it seems much keener on dropping casually
like Funkmaster Flex, and I’d already grown tired in my young age,
so tired, of trying to prove I’m not stupid even above trying to prove
I’m smart. And those who doubt there’s a difference have digging
to do, deep into their pockets to get me what I’m owed for damages,
for emotional distress and all things it’s been made feasible to sue for
with solid legal representation. Funny, I once longed to be a lawyer,
little fool that I was, my back against a brick wall painted by spotlight,
rifles lined and aiming, in that night’s vision—legal fluency seemed
the only option for release from this burden because it’s the language
my nemeses speak in. I do know bad English from black, but I know
power even better because I’ve brushed up against it just as a person
in any number of neighborhoods around here may have brushed up
against a police officer. Maybe it’s needless to say I didn’t go down
an attorney path; I actually don’t have a plan at all these days except
evading the bullet and also the bullet points corporations thrive on,
as if any of this is simple, as if I, symptom of systemic dysfunctions
enveloped by skeleton and skin, am something simple. I’d only ever
be two-dimensional if airbrushed on a blank T-shirt and even that
would show depth to someone’s esteem for who I was with no one
else nearby, and all this means is that there is more to me or anyone
alike than being menace or miscreant, minstrel or misanthrope, or
murdered as all four would be with equal fanfare. But what I really
want is to know what they feel when their black friend dies in that
typical way for it’s maybe the only thing I don’t know about them,
while we practice poker faces and draft FAQs. Forget seeing eye to
eye for a second. Set aside the particular grammars of forgiveness
we use without pulling up the problem’s root: do they still feel full
people if they put the hammer down? And when they can’t answer,
make note that I can because I have those tools and also others that
shall remain nameless in order to remain purposeful. That’s how I
prefer it, besting all desertions of their decency, which I say since
you’ve caught me rare and raw tonight, sipping off the bottle top,
slurring my songs, hitting my two-step on beat every. single. time.
Damn—how blessed they are to be able to watch me work around
them—as illegibly as what the miraculous Phillis Wheatley wrote
all over her master’s walls, owned in the moment, I feel, solely by
an ambition toward self-definition I also try applying prodigiously,
bringing them to speechlessness, a shaming kind of silence sayinglisten, leave me be because there’s no explaining me, thus there’s
no exploiting me: what only a history under thumb and foot helps
grasp before letting go, for one’s own good even more than mine.

He looked down at his withering body and saw a hair near his navel, swaying.   And now he saw his other hairs rise up.   He felt a hectic current in his veins. Looking within, he saw the bubbling of his blood.   He cursed his fever, saying: “It is the chemistry of prayer. It increases in frequency, seeding panic to all my being. My cells swell with the liquid of guilt they fabricate, juices of hatred eat my belly my corpuscles make war in me as they devour each other. My head heats in the combustion of anxiety, I am polluted by the secretions of my soul’s decay, while my brain wears away with the scratching night and day on the encephalograph of prayer. I grow monstrous with the leukemia of the world.”   And he heard the hair say: “Hear me.” And he saw it grow gray as it waved. All his hairs he saw whiten, and, numberless, wilt from their erect electric listening. He saw them topple from their roots. “How dare you!” he cursed them. There surged a brief resuscitation to his body. His heart took heart and pounded twice with the health of fear But then the plague of prayer redoubled and overwhelmed him.   In his feebleness he raged, and said: “I will tear out this evil and free it.”With his withered hands he tore the remaining hairs from his body and head. With his nails he opened his breast, and with his fist he exploded his heart, which erupted, a black and red volcano.   As his brain tasted, for the first time, the birth of his doom, he came a rolling tide, a floating mountain of ecstasy. “I see you! I love you!” his eyes cried, overflowing with his bright blood. “You were the light of the world that are now my gushing tears— the kind and fiery tears of chaos, that wash my eyes with the cure of oblivion.”   “He hears us!” cried his sick blood pouring from his ears. “Even as of old he heard our hair before it perished.”   With his last strength, the chemistry of prayer, a few drops of his blood coagulated. That clot whirled out, free, in the vortex of the universe.

“I fucked up bad”: Justin cracks his neck,talking to nobody. Fifteen responsible children,final semester college seniors, bloodshot,collars undone, gorgeously exhausted, return from Wall Street interviews in attitudes of surrender on the Dinky—the one-car commuter train connecting Princeton to the New York line. Panic-sweat sheens their faces. Justin hasn’t seen me yet. “Something’s fucked with my tie.” He’s right. I see his future, the weight he’ll gain first in his face, then gut and ass, the look of bad luck he’ll haunt his bad jobs with. He tears off the tie. Elephants on it. Fatigue, swollen ankles, the midwife said. The worst discomforts of pregnancy. I wrote those down. But she’s wrong: self-pity. Strange dreams, she said. No dreams. Discarded newspapers—business section, money, real estate, auto—sift apart to quartos and folios underfoot. “Shut up, Justin,” says the girl across from him.

There’s a half-moon in half-clouds up over the tracks. Justin spreads over three seats, texts with his thumbs, talks: “The Lehman Brothers guy asks me, Did you ever sell anything? Sell me a bottle of water. I’m like fu-uck. To say something I say ‘Why do you like water?’ He says...” Justin fixes a diamond stud back in his ear. “They’ll let me know.” Fifteen responsible childrensigh in disappointed relief.

She gobblessnack-pack popcorn, licks her fingers; bits dropyellow from her lips. “My mom will go crazyDeutsche Bank didn’t offer.” She sees me.“I didn’t realize that was you with your hair up.Look, Just.” She high-fives me. “It’s Professor.”Is Brianna crying? “Don’t call me Professor,” I say, dozens of times a semester. “I’m a writer, not a teacher.” Justin grabs a Norton Anthology out of his five-hundred-dollar briefcase. “Fuck.What are we supposed to read for tomorrow?”“Prufrock, dummy,” Brianna says. “You’re a good professor.” She condescends through tears. “Poor baby,” mocks Justin, slumping so low in the seat I only see his shoe soles on the arm rest. The train swooshes through suburban tracts. The moon gets smaller. Brianna arrives mornings to workshop in a fake hurry and the sweats she slept in, probably rolls backin bed after.

Toward what island-home am I moving,not wanting to marry, not wanting too much of that emptiness at evening, as when I walked through a field at duskand felt wide in the night.And it was again the evening that drew meback to the field where I was most alone,compassed by stems and ruts, no light of the fixed stars, no flashing in the eyes, only heather pared by dry air, shedding a small feathered radiance when I looked away,an expanse whose deep sleep seemed an unending warren I had been given, to carry out such tasks—that I might find nothing dead.  And it was again the evening that drew meback to the field where I could sense no boundary—the smell of dry earth, cool arch of my neck, the darkness entirely within myself.  And when I shut my eyes there was no one.Only weeds in drifts of stillness, only stalks and gliding sky.Come, black anchor, let us not be harmed.The deer leafing in the dark.The old man at the table, unable to remember.The children whose hunger is just hunger, and never desire.

Clairedressed for daycare in daffodil yellow and jelly shoes.David’s gaze was an emperor’s surveying a desiccatedbattlefield. Since he viewed everything that way, we all            saw him the same.The psych techs in Cloroxed whitewere giant angels who set us running drills, at whichwe sucked. The zones we set out to defend were wateryat every edge. We missed close chest passes, easy combos. Our metronomes run different tempos,             John proclaimed. Then Claire started seeing dashes stutter through the air behind the ball.Then speed lines on our backs, and then her own head went wobbly as a spinning egg. She’d once trackedplanetary orbits for NASA and now sat sidelined            by her eyes’ projections. Only Bill had game.Catatonic Bill whose normal talent was to schlubdays in a tub chair — his pudding face scarredwith chicken pox — using his hand for an ashtray,belly for an armrest. Now all that peeled away, and he             emerged, clean as an egg. He was a litheand licorice boy, eeling past all comers, each shotsheer net. He faked both ways, went left. Beneath the orange rim his midair pirouettes defied the gravity that Icould barely sludge through. He scored beyond what even             Claire could count,then he bent panting,hands on knees as the orderlies held out water cups,and the rest of us reached to pat his back or slaphis sweaty hand, no one minding about the stench or his breath like old pennies. Then as quick as that             he went.Inside his headsome inner winch did reel him back from the frontof   his face bones where he’d been ablaze. He went back and back into that shadowed stare. Lucky we were to breathehis air. Breath is God’s intent to keep us living. He was             the self   I’d come inwanting to kill, and I left him there.

If  leaf-trash chokes the stream-bed,reach for rock-bottom as you rakethe muck out. Let it slump dank,and dry fading, flat above the bank.Stand back. Watch the water vault ahead.Its thrust sweeps the surface clean, shores the debris,as it debrides its stone path to the lake,clarity carrying clarity.To see clear, resist the drag of  images.Take nature as it is, not Dame nor Kind.Act in events; touch what you name. Abhoreasy obverts of natural metaphor.Let human speech breathe out its best poor bridgesfrom mind to world, mind to self, mind to mind.Yet, I admit the event of the wood thrush:     In a footnote Langer (her book rapids-clean     like the spring-water aired over sleeked rock)     says she witnessed an August bird in shock     when a hawk snatched its mate. It perched, rushed     notes fluting two life-quotas in one flood,     its lungs pushing its voice, flushing the keen     calls, pumped out as the heart pumps blood,     not in twilight or warning but noon & wrong,     its old notes whistled too fast but accurate.I read this drenched in bird-panic, its spine-fusing loss all song, all loss; that loss mineawash in unanswered unanswered song.And I cannot claim we are not desolate.

Slow goes the drag of creation, how what’s within comes to be without,which is the rhythmic erection of essence. Life’s little deaths, petite orgasms, as the French nearly saidbut never came to. Feathers outstrip the weatheras we stand with binoculars inquiring how winged creatures can hold their blood to warmthwithout a proper insulation system overlaying circulation.That is, sans fat and simple wooden bones with hair glued on.Mostly though they pulsate on the horizons of backlit vision,where we only meet the subways with handshakes, the rainbow filters of downloaded electronica,the telephone poles as archaic checkpoints to past cultures.They don’t have screens to seek their cues in.We drift from one culture to another and fight the stitcheries of racism, classism, anti-Muslim terrorists among us, with overlaps in the complete dis-ease our bodiessettle into for next to no resistance.So we create something else. As in, roughshod moments of fake hatewill position a fluid hello of death rattlesthat settle for the injunction of existence and state: Here am I made manifest by not being you, by not going in the same unsteady destination, by not asking the questions or repeating the paintings that came before me, by not singing in the register of  your bubble bathsas you hug that person close in a wish to outlast bullets, even as the light leaves your eyes just a little next time we overlap paths.So the hens and geese make us think in terms of helpoutside, how they flap and move with fat ease in front of trains,across the chopping block, to the hungry winters of final leviathans,even as they land just so on the wires above us, and we go on complaining, murderous, too far out, unspoken.

She gets up early and makes buttermilk pancakes using normal milk soured with lemon juice. She tries things out. Arlene tells us to stay away from sharp things or we’ll cut ourselves. Esme does what she likes. She grates apple for a new recipe and cuts her knuckle and laughs. I don’t know if I can live my life. I don’t know if I can look after someone as unafraid as Esme. I don’t know how to change what I do, the way someone eating soup will, out of habit, bite down. Esme laughs; she’s serving up apple pancakes with banana and maple syrupand she says, You are a whole person. A row of mornings fan out.And the pancakes are sweet and slightly gummy with a salt edge.

Is this mountain all rock, or are there any villages on it?These are some of the things I said to her.We bake because it is a way of overcoming.In the journey of zest, I see myself.On the news every day people are standing up screamingor lying down screaming while others remain calm.She pointed out that I had not made eye contactwith her at all. Then I cried properly in a short burst.This is the worst example of any circumstance ever,noted a journalist in his notebook.Let butter and chocolate be a wish not to die!I implored the bain-marie. She likened me to a sieve.I clutch all my poems to my chest and count themagain and again. I am kneeling like a small dog.What’s going on with this modern worldand the right wife not even knowingwhat the left wife is doing? Now all you have to dois cut off the legs. After an absence, after a hard task,after the way the hand turns, like this —There was so much I couldn’t contain.She asked me how I was feeling in my bodyat this moment; I said tense in my whole trunk area.A strong smell of white wine. She said it came froman impulse that she often used to have when she firststarted practicing. She said she believed feelingsare held in the body. She asked me what was going onwith my breath and I realized I was sort of holding it.Like the boxes in the cupboard. “Enough” can get bigger.How much bigger, though? When I sayI’ve had enough, how will you know when to stop?

               1 Rain fell as a glass breaks,something suddenly everywhere at the same time.               2 To live like a painting looked into from more than one angle at once —eye to eye with the doorway,down at the hair,up at your own dusty feet.                 3 “This is your house,”said my bird heart to my heart of the cricket, and I entered.                4 The happy see only happiness,the living see only life,the young see only the young,as lovers believethey wake always beside one also in love.                5 However often I turned its pages,I kept ending up as the same two sentences of the book:The being of some is: to be. Of others: to be without.Then I fell back asleep, in Swedish.                6 A sheep grazing is unimpressed by the mountainbut not by its flies.                7 The griefof what hasn’t yet happened —a door closed from inside.The weight of the grass dividingan ant’s five-legged silencewalking through it.                8 What is the towel, what is the water, changes,though of we three, only the towel can be held upside down in the sun.                9 “I was once.”Said not in self-pity or praise.This dignity we allow barn owl, ego, oyster.

The Indiscriminate Citizenry of Earth are out to arrest my sense of being a misfit. “Open up!” they bellow, hands quiet before my door that’s only wind and juniper needles, anyway.  You can’t do it, I squeak from inside. You can’t make me feel at home here in this time of siege for me and mine, mi raza. Legalized suspicion of my legitimacy is now a permanent resident in my gut.  “Fruit of the prickly pear!” they swear, striding up to my table to juice me a glass of pink nectar. They’ve brought welcome baskets stuffed with proof I’m earthling.  From under a gingham cover, I tug a dark feather iridescing green — cohering to “magpie” thought, to memory’s chatter, to mind. Mine.  And here they have my mind translated into a slate-surfaced pond, which vibrates in the shape of a cottonwood’s autumn molt, which trees me to dirt, which soils me heat & freeze —  But you’ll always be one definitive document short! I complain. Doubts can forever outstrip your geo-logic.  For which they produce a lock of my natal dust, bronzed to the fluttering fiber of lacebark pine.  Where’d they get that stuff?  The baskets are bottomless, and it’s useless for me to insist on being distinct. Undergoing re-portation, I’m awakened to a Center,  where walls between all beings are dreamt to dissolve.

The fair wind failed. The wind dropped. Winds were unfavourable straightaway. The favourable wind dropped and they were beset by storms so that they made little progress. Then the wind dropped and they were beset by winds from the north and fog; for many days they did not know where they were sailing. The fair wind failed and they wholly lost their reckoning. They did not know from what direction. Driven here and there. The fog was so dense that they lost all sense of direction and lost their course at sea. There was much fog and the winds were light and unfavourable. They drifted far and wide on the high sea. Most of those on board completely lost their reckoning. The crew had no idea in which direction they were steering. A thick fog which did not lift for days. The ship was driven off course to land. They were tossed about at sea for a long time and failed to reach their destination.

All morning my daughter pleading, outsideoutside.

I manage at last to tunnelher hands into mittens and she barks andwon’t stop barking, her hands suddenly paws.She is reduced to another being,barking, barking all day in these restraints.For days after, she howls into her hands,the only way she tells me she wants out.

To keep anxiety at bay, my friend called chemo dragonfly love. Those insects — christened, in places, the devil’s darning needles — hover as they contort their joined bodies into a heart, the male with pincers. Finger cutter, horse killer, ear stick, eye pisser. Look closely at the eyes of a female darner and you may well see dark puncture marks. As a slow drip through an IV. As a pill. Through a port into a vein. She called nausea erotica. Just the same, we name our storms to lessen them —  not a tropical cyclone, but Arabella, with ballet shoes and bun. Tumors, too, were friends, waiting at the bus stop with backpacks in the morning. Cindy French braids Carrie’s hair, yanking at the scalp to form the tight crisscross. Not hair loss, but deep conditioning. She gave us the new lexicon on stationery embossed with a red rose speckled by raindrops. The stem still had its thorns. Ring-around-the-rosy, red rover, red rover, send her right over. She called death the world of 10,000 things: the dragon courting its damsel, catheter tubing in the wastebin, video of a toddler biting his brother, pas de deux, full- sugar ice cream, Crimson Queen, Trumpeter, Red Knockout, Tuscany Superb  ...    I knew her as Rose Shapiro. At the funeral I learned she was born Passalacqua: to cross the river, to pass a glass of water.

Amidst the glossy dark green foliageof trees around the hotel pool,I spy a low-hanging golden fruit.So many trees whose names I do not knowand for the first time do not care to learn.The overwhelming now in its countless inflectionscancels vocabulary: eyes lips skininstead of words. Still in the pool,floating on my back as the sun gets low,I look at the mango, if that is what it is(I think it is some wholly other fruit),and suddenly smell garlic sautéed in butter.Chefs in the kitchen under the treesare getting the hors d’oeuvres ready.Yesterday in a dim, airless gallery,following your lead,I hunted down an iconographywritten in a grisly alphabetyet full of life, the haunting gaze direct,transcending death. Death had in winning lost.Art trumped death and life trumped art. Last night(our third together — sleepa whole new texture in a bed with you)I gave you space and found myself at the borderof a far province in the king-sized bed,a dimly lit hinterland where paintings ruled,a region wholly devoted to the workof the same painter, mysteriously killed,stoned to death (“lapidated” was one word),assassinated — why? A mysteryto be solved by iconography?Death had won but also death had lost.Garlic and butter. Glossy dark green leaves.Voices across the pool. A hanging fruit.An azure splash. And as the sun goes down,you sit by the window in our room,drawing pictures of this this this time.What to call it? Colors in your handstrump words. Like the fruit,like the solution to the mystery,something I am at a loss to name.

In the story of my life there is a book.The book was bound in rough green cloth.Its glossy pages smelled oddly like puke. The book told the story of two children,Johnnie and Jill, I think.They got lost in a deep forest,drawn in thick dark ink. They were brother-and-sister orphans.They met fantastical creatures.One was the goddess of spring, or was that in Botticelli’s picturethat I saw in the same libraryin a book of art history for kids,old European art of course.

There were seven colors of mourning, one was lilac. That kind of blossomalways has its crowd, fanned out, surroundedby crushing likeness, smell of itself.  Fabric has to breathe, at least 2%, like skin.  A little milkfat, elastane even in the gravest print. Not knowing how to grieve can poisonlike a directionless dart. And although fabric has been known to swirl and clasp, be clasped —   without mother there’s only art. To hug the body: a swath, anathema, magical, seventies lace and spacedust, all too far gone to truly love. But to twist it, to learn to hate-want.

Everything actually is blurred, not just how you see. Glasses and shoes are solutionsto problems that are real problems, that of blurred world, that of touching the ground. A glass corset for the heart to see out its chest. For without glasses, the eye better seesthe wind, by feeling it and closing against its grains, its grasses. For without shoes, my feet become shoes. When I am really feeling,I get very tired, I fall asleep for the seventeenth timeon the unfinished skirt of glass eyes and lemon  zest hemmed first, grown last.

Every possibility that colors are believable, various, not that mirage I thought I’d seen and can be held apart as unreal,too exterior, distinct from each other wildly as sparks to seaweedor flower to meteor. It collapsed, can’t draw it can’t cut it out of itself. There is no color but what’s alreadyinside the eye, no power or invention or new way to wake up in the morning outside the seeing mechanism, our own orbs. Yet I can’t see myself.I can never see you again. I can only see from inside my skulland when I look down I close everything not just my eyes. I wrap my own tender nether flesh in calfskin leather so buttery, melted back together like so: a newborn softenedin its own mother’s milk.• I awoke in a panic (no ma no ma) to the smallest day yet.I dreamed I alreadydreamed all the dreams I’d get. This morning I dressed in my last dress’s last dress, fit only for a genteel gothic murder, covered up well — airtight,would only fit the stabbed one, after bloodlet.Then, like a glove. Who wears it and where?I will, from the bed to the chair. Headrest, clotheshorse.Designer and model: mutually orbiting the best metaphor for bodiless idea. Amorphous, amorous, amoral, immortal. Red is dead, said blue, to you too? Hindquarter-gauze with silver face clampand sickened ears pulled, unskulled. Broken backpiece. Shadow sensible by other than sight. To smell a shadow.To strike it. To trace it later, to measure a body by its line. Light’s so quiet. You’d think its cuttings, its edge-hole,those mousy children, would squeakat least a bit. They run like a stockingdown the leg of the mind. Why not quieter then? There is no body without life.There is no mind without body.There is no without.

At the Mind Museum, you can walk to the back,step on several large buttons on the ground,and watch parts of the brain light up: the frontal lobefor decision and memory, the temporal lobefor smell and sound, the occipital for sight. I tryto make my toddler son laugh by hoppingfrom one button to the next, watching each lobelight up along the way, but he will not leave the prisonof his melancholy.

Through a dark channelhe was born; to darkness he is most drawn. Easierto write than say the guilt I feel for giving himthe sharp pain of melancholy. My son, alwaysin the world without husk or shell, it is as if his heartthrobs on the outside of his body, as if his brainhas no skull to absorb the assaults that strike it.Today, I watch him writhe in the pain of a tantrum —a typical kid, this is what they do, everyone assures me — and usually I rush in, unwittingly increasinghis sense of emergency. Instead, today, I stand back,relinquish the role of skull and skin, watch his mindunfurl like a medieval tapestry.

1. brett returns my mother to the wilderness
I slipped them into my friend’s palm — 
the tiny crucifix, and dove,
from off my mother’s pendant watch — 
and I asked her to walk them up through the brush
toward timberline, and find a place
to hurl them, for safekeeping. Now,
she writes, “I walked up the canyon at dusk,
warm, with a touch of fall blowing down the canyon,
came to an outcrop, above a steep
drop — far below, a seasonal
creek, green willows. I stood on a boulder
and held out my hand. I wished your mother all the
love in the world, and I sent the talismans
flying off the cliff. They were so small,
and the wind was blowing, so I never saw or
heard them land.” My mother is where
I cannot find her, she is gone beyond
recall, she lies in her sterling shapes
light as the most weightless bone in the body, her
stirrup bone, which was ground up
and sown into the sea. I do not know
what a soul is, I think of it
as the smallest, the core, civil right. And she
is wild now with it, she touches and is
touched by no one knows — down, or
droppings of a common nighthawk,
root of bird’s foot fern, antenna of
Hairstreak or Echo Azure, or stepped on by the
huge translucent Jerusalem cricket. There was
something deeply right about
the physical elements — atoms, and cells,
and marrow — of my mother’s body,
when I was young, and now her delicate
insignias receive the direct
touch of the sun, and scatter it,
unseen, all over her home.
 
 2. cross and dove  
I had not wanted them, and I hadn’t known
what to do with them, the minuscule
symbols of my mother’s religion,
I looked for a crack in the stone floor of the
cathedral but could not find one. Then I thought
of the wilderness near Desolation,
and asked my friend to carry them up
to a peak of granite, and let the wind take them. Since
then, it has been as if my mother’s
spirit matter has been returned
into the great bank of matter,
as her marrow had been sifted down into
the ocean. It doesn’t matter, now, if I
ever wanted to disassemble
my mother. The sixteenth-of-an-inch-
across cross, and the silver line drawing
of a dove are cached, somewhere, that is nowhere
to be found. Now I think of the nature of metal, and how
long the soul-dolls of her trust will last in their
spider-egg-sac of roots, needles,
quartz, feathers, dust, snow, shed
claw. Her belief she would have an eternal
life was absolute, I think.
It would not be good to think of my mother
without her God — like a hermit howling in the
moonscape of a desert. Once, when she was old — like an
exquisite child playing a crone
in the school play — we talked about heaven.
She wasn’t sure exactly how, but she
knew her father would be there, and her elder
brother, and her second husband —
maybe it was a heaven for four,
the three men and her. It was so
easy to make my mother happy
in her last years, to tell her that I
could just see her, as a kitten, in God’s
lap, being petted. Her eyes sparkled with more
beams than any other eyes I have seen.
I have sent the tokens of her everlasting being
into the high altitude.
They will shine long after I can sing her — sing what I
perceived through the distorted prisms of my vision.
I don’t know if I saw my mother
or did not see her. Day and night,
her charms will gleam in the brush or stream, will
reflect the mountain light in little
pieces of unreadable language.

The dodo, maybe? Its temporality is other.
Its inability to adapt rendered it obsolete.
And so this prop here is adaptable as if to right evolutionary wrongs.
It encourages a certain flight, of the sitter’s focus inward, when tilting back, and when sitting straight, to one’s surroundings, an outrospection.

I have never needed God
as a personal savior
in my practical life
syllogisms about His existence
were never music to my ears
but always seemed vague
missing a dimension although I didn’t know how to say this.
Neither a philosophical God nor a biblical God
suddenly appears among His creations
amid revelations of wisdom in Jerusalem, His city.
And certainly not in disclosures of pious inner principles
and also not among poets, unfortunately.
Astronomical bodies at night and mystical landscapes in Sharafat for example
and Beit Jala
bear His between-the-lines existence,
His inklings.
The expression of an ultra-Orthodox man’s eyes in Mea She’arim — 
this too — 
and even the purifying surrender of a sly and seasoned merchant, irreligious now in Geula,
when you reproach him.
Something like “Reprove a wise man and he will love you.”
And you, when you cleanse yourself of anxious constraints about your environment
after taking hash or grass.
Springs of purity whose origins you’re unaware of
bubble in coursing blood, in glands, in milk
and some paradisiacal primeval revelation,
and your almost subconscious innerness
your being suddenly revealed — 
Is this clear enough to you, heredity? Genes?
Or existential uniqueness, a maintained infancy that knocks you out with a sense of a refreshing genesis.
Everything becomes clear in a great light.
You shed revulsion and resistance,
a great love germinates within you — 
this gloriousness this wonder
comprised of
absolutes of — 
objective truth, complete justice, decency
honor internalized
honesty and complex wisdom enhanced down to the last detail.
Ho, complete, divine purity.
Suddenly you polish a syllogism of your own
for decisive proof of His existence:
God is an idea — 
ideas don’t have material existence
but they exist nonetheless
so God exists definitively as the spirit of an idea,
the biblical assertion “He has no body and no bodily form”
is clear to me now as an exegesis
that sits well with philosophy.

I was listening to a book on tape while driving
and when the author said, “Those days I delighted in everything,”
I pulled over and found a pencil and a parking ticket stub
because surely there was a passage of life where I thought
“These days I delight in everything,” right there in the
present, because they almost all feel like that now,
memory having markered only the outline while evaporating
the inner anxieties of earlier times. Did I not disparage
my body for years on end, for instance, although, in contrast
that younger one now strikes me as near-Olympian?
And the crushing preoccupations of that same younger self
might seem magically diluted, as though a dictator
in hindsight, had only been an overboard character — 
but not so. Where went the fear, dense as the sudden
dark in the woods, of being alone, or the bruise of 3:30 pm
in a silent apartment, when the disenfranchised live
only with the sunlight through the blinds, just prey
caught betwixt and between, and also heartbreak, and
again, heartbreak. I didn’t have whatever that time of life
then demanded — a book, a wedding band, a baby — 
but the present, like the lie of “fair and balanced” news reporting
where creationists are granted air time with the scientists,
the present might have me believe that “in those days
I delighted in everything.” But to be ... fair and balanced ...
I do trust the strict part of memory, the only archivist
to have savored a passage of time and have preserved it
with the translucent green hinges licked by stamp collectors,
attaching it without hurting it, so I wanted the quote
exactly, and go back to hunt and tag those months where I
delighted in everything — then I couldn’t find the ticket stub.
I rummaged through the recycling but no luck, and I
couldn’t go back to find the passage on tape, and then I realized
I had bought the book for my husband, so I started leafing through it,
not wanting to start too far back, and not wanting
my eyes to fall on a passage in the future, the one where
she realizes that “Those days I delighted in everything,”
but it was never to happen again, just the present, from here on in.

Identification is a highly important factor in the mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled in their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the experiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it were, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by means of their own personalities alone.

Anne identified with Cate until it became a bona fide
illness, for Boris had left Cate, resulting not only
in psychic estrangement but an unconscious stream
of hostility directed not at Boris, but at his new woman,
Anne, whom Cate viewed as her rival. Cate remained
excessively tender with Boris, though Cate, for him,
had been a “totem animal” from which he gained power
by “eating.” Whereas Boris was the patriarch,
Anne was the ego alien; and whereas Cate was Anne’s
fixation, Anne was no one’s obsession, so she was
admitted to a psychiatric ward with the unbidden
associations she could not be induced to abandon.
On the rare occasions she slept, the manifest and latent
content of her dreams was the dance of abandonment
between Boris and Cate, which Anne, in her waking hours,
projected onto the walls, as though screening a silent film.
She could not be induced to abandon this footage;
she could not be induced to abandon her object love
of Boris (whose own object choice was his
ego-libido); or her identification with Cate, who felt
no friendship towards Anne. Soon Anne drew a mental

hierarchical in a glass case; the blow-up vinyl wolf
         bobbing from a pilgrim’s staff.
Lured as I was by the bar-b-que’s black smoke,

blistered pink on a spit, made its agonized slow roll,

Or so my poisoned soul announced, as if scorn

weren’t some outward form of inner scorn,

As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.   
I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.   
I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses   
And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.
They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff   
Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,   
So it is impossible to tell how many there are.
My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.   
Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——
My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,   
My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   
Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.
I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat   
stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.   
Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley   
I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books   
Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.   
I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.
I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them   
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.   
The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe   
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.   
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,   
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,   
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.
Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.   
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me

And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow   
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,   
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.   
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.
Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.   
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.   
They concentrate my attention, that was happy   
Playing and resting without committing itself.
The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;   
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,   
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.

the cocktail napkin and the globe of cognac’s
fragrant on the zinc bar. Fields of chamomile.   
Close your eyes and then the night turns to coal
seamed with diamonds. Outside, a girl murmurs
her tired price, in pesetas, to passing men.   Irita, the barman calls when she wanders in
to wash at the single coldwater tap. Just a fly-blown
café on your functionary’s street of flats, bedrooms
shuttered around their whispering, the shops that gleam
by day with scaled cellophane piglets, mounded bins
of fruit and olives. Irita rewinds her hair
at the bar, a gilt rosette nestling its waves,   
tattered bullfight posters on the wall behind her
and you think of Rita Hayworth tossing roses
in Blood and Sand, the frayed banderilla.   
Such a lovely thing to torture an animal with,
the corrida’s exacting choreography
of life and death. Sometimes it’s soothing to evaporate
in this smoke-patinaed air, abandoning
your imposter’s life of embassy files breathing
the military names and numbers, Torrejón’s
precise cold barracks. Your face wavers, oddly calm
in the mirror as the girl talks dancing and   
flamenco clubs to the barman, absinthe glass shining
derangement in his hand. It’s the place in the night
where you carve an uneasy confederacy   
from vapor and exhaustion, a trio—the alien,
the clownish poseur, the girl with nothing to sell
but herself and straitened, cataleptic dreams.
She stretches, plays idly the slot machines
spinning roses, babies and lemons, the brilliant
suit of lights. The caramel glow of the barlamps haloes
her hair, bitten lips. Another sip and the slots’
click is rosary beads wafting prayers up
to a heaven of slink and spangle, quick bargains
struck in alcoves, that old palm of chapped fingers
slipping coins to the gas meter, of spreading stain
across the counterpane. Around Bar Xanadu
narrow streets fill with the violet steam
of after-midnight, the pigeons’ soft venereal   
cooing that speak of want like this, that deep
original loneliness. There are heartless places

its window of warmth and the drifting years return   
bordered with the crimes of night, with cramped
rooms you’ve climbed to, dead as the money
in your pockets. A “dimestore Mata Hari,”
the bureau chief called you while he snipped
a fresh cigar. On parched plains outside the city
soldier boys drill before the fighter planes, glamorous
with starlight, still floating half-asleep

your fingers the napkin snows its raddled lace

the magic shoes to Irita’s feet

riffling your skirt in the scent of blood oranges and sweat.

In-and-out sun   like the light of her mind   that knows
and doesn’t   feels and forgets   pelts of rain
hid and seek   of thought   first gray then rose
but still a steady backlight   (sometimes hidden):
“Remember Woody Allen’s line?   I’m not   
like that   I don’t care when it happens   where
I just don’t want to die   not scared   not that
I just don’t want to   and I told the doctor!”
and the doctor   laughing “Cute old lady   said
she doesn’t care about the why and wherefore
she just doesn’t want to die . . .” and therefore?
then she forgets   smiles   turns her head
to nod   grande dame   at shadows on the walls
that gather where the light collects   and falls
2
They gather   where the light collects and falls
we can’t see them   but she seems to think
at least a few are smiling   so she feels
she has to say hello   politely thank
these thoughtful ghosts who visit   sister   brothers
Sunday best in black   old Brooklyn friends
who hardly see   the gulf of sixty years
mama and papa   severe Sicilian bookends
“Come in, come in” her eyes light up   she waves
and beckons all to chairs around her bed
so she can boast to brothers   and their wives
of all the special things   her daughter did
and how her grandkids won   so many prizes
and as she vaunts   and glows   her smile blazes
3
But though she glows   but though her smile blazes
the sister flickers   fades   the brothers falter
her eyesight’s bad   it’s hard to see their faces
as if she peered through gauze   or a thick filter
and then the others come   the ones she calls
“co-tenants” of her rooms   the lovers screwing
coarse as goats   in corners   nasty girls
smart-aleck guys   who do know what they’re doing
and what they do   is occupy her place
back home they swarmed   all over her apartment
set up a stove   behind her lovely bookcase
nursed babies on her sofa   bold indifferent
and even here   still shameless in their clingings
they mean to steal   they’ll steal   her best belongings
4
What should she do   to safeguard   her belongings?
she begs for help   urges us to lock
to triple lock   the doors   to hide her things
her pearls right   here   her fruitwood in New York
her mother’s hand-carved walnut chairs   the leather-
surfaced desk   at which my father sat
so long ago   wearing the cashmere sweater
grandma bought him   and the Sulka shirt
Listen!   Are we listening!   Have we heard?
How well he dressed!   How beautiful their place!
four rooms in Queens   what lots couldn’t afford
in an age of breadlines   shameful jobs   or worse
“Tuono di Dio!”   thunder of God   she looses
the curse she learned in childhood   for most uses
5
The curses learned   in childhood   have their usesTuono di Dio!   she swears when they strip her   bare
to bathe her   Tuono di Dio!   when the nurses
slide the soiled bed pads   to the floor
or prop her   in the wheelchair   to be fed
thunder of God   echoes along the halls
when she tries to fight   the husky nurse’s aide
come to sponge her bruises   stains and spills
embarrassed   we shiver   in the corridor
while she flails   and shrieks for the police
“Tuono di Dio!   Call the police!”   God’s thunder
will scorch us if we leave her   in this place
away from her apartment   calm   and peace
away from her belongings   purse and keys
6
Away from her belongings   purse   and keys
(and crumpled Kleenex   reading glasses coins
and comb she always   carries   in that purse)
she isn’t real!   she might be only bones!
yet the belongings   longings   must go on
the bookcase and the rugs   and tables must
survive   outlast her   so she tells her grandson
how to plan an auction   in the east
there are the costs   of those belongings   that
the value of mahogany   and this
the price of sterling silver (which she fought
to buy—a fifth-grade teacher   in the thirties—)
and the bracelets   furs   her in-laws gave
too bad they can’t   go with her to the grave!
7
What happens to belongings   after the grave?
They’ll be   up here and she   she’ll be   down there
what of the   stuff she worked   so hard   to have?
polished mahogany   and mink   and silver
and even the fifteen-year-old   television
still good   still just right for the nightly news
and the brand-new   vacuum cleaner   even
still a— a something   someone ought   to choose
her face is crumpling   like a handkerchief
don’t give it all   away   don’t give it up
if you don’t want it   at least sell it off!
don’t let the others   have it either   stop
the thieves before   they drag it all    away
don’t let my belongings   go astray. . . .
8
Don’t let my   belongings   go astray
call the super   tell the doorman   keep
the windows locked   and barred   the crooks away
the one who break   and enter   when you sleep
the ones   who follow   sullen   knife and rape
how many years   she’s warned us   can’t we hear
they’ll pick the locks   they’ll climb the fire   escape
just look   the crooks are here   are everywhere
a sudden nod   a glance at   the next bed
where a wizened   person   gasps and snoresthat one now   she saw her   yes she did
peering in closets   rummaging in drawers
even in hospitals   they have   no pity
they rob you   when they see   your things are   pretty
9
Yet O it’s nice   that all her things are   pretty
her smile blazes   back in Jackson Heights
(on one of the   better   blocks   in New York City)
her beautiful   apartment   basks and waits
a hush of rugs   a drawn Venetian   blind
keeping the silence   keeping the bars   of shadow
gathered like silent   guardians   around
the hanging   shelf   the Wedgewood   the piano
and there the family   photographs   are massed
my father’s face   blade-thin   in sepia
my baby self   in flounces   or undressed
from times   when she was poor   but happier
belongings blurry   as if   underwater
bearing the prints   of mother   father   daughter
10
How far the age   of mother   father   daughter!
my baby room with walls   now pink   now blue
(but never yellow   though I begged   I fought her)
and the tiny snowman   globe   where snowflakes   flew
and the little silver   Virgin Mary   shrine
whose key I   turned   to play Our Lady’s song
“Ave Maria”   tinkling   out of tune
and the gray   hooked rug   where silent bluebirds sang
and a rabbit ran   away   among the trees
but never   vanished   never could   escape
whatever chased him   from the knitted haze
a scary   thing   because   it had no shape
though now the whole   room’s painted hazy   gray
and the rabbit   trees   and birds   raveled away
11
When did her mind   begin to ravel   away?
—that time she fell   outside   the beauty parlor
(getting pretty for   her grandson’s    birthday)?
she didn ’t   answer   when we tried   to call her
and soon   with mop and broom   she fought the others
called 911   the super   the police
there on the sofa   sat   the nursing mothers
the lovers   crawled and thrashed   under the bookcase
we flew   to Queens   we packed up all   her things
the fox-head furs   her mother ’s lion-necklace
“But what about all my other   best   belongings?”
she worried   then gave up   resigned   to silence
a roar of takeoff   buckled in   she hissed
“Here’s to my new   adventure   in the west!”
12
At sundown   tantrums   shake the sunset west
the nurses turn her toward the flashing   window
“See the flowers? See the pretty bird’s nest?”
bushes tug in tubs   on the patio
where a night   wind   rises   over Astroturf
batters the waiting   tables   chairs   and wheelchairs
as if they stood   in a swirl   of Pacific surf
whose icy water   glitters   darkens   clears
“Here’s dinner, hon!” the nurse’s aide   with bib
holds out a tray of lukewarm   grown-up   mush
last week a fall   tore muscles   cracked a ribhow did   she fall   did someone   really push?
she tries to remember   strains to see   remembers
(sometimes) the names   of sundown   visitors
13
Sometimes the names   of sundown visitors
hook into thought   sometimes the sounds   unravel
blur   sister   brothers   TV commentators
(Frank and Vito turn into Ted Koppel)
I visit   afternoons   bring cupcakes   chocolate
the only stuff she   ever wants   to eat
can barely swallow though   one night past midnight
she coughs   a little   chokes on   her own spit
the night nurse   didn’t hear   the radio
was turned on loud   she’s kind of scared   and sorry
and puts a rose   on the poor   old lady’s   pillow
and a mortician   calls   and tells us   not to worry
above the sunlit bay   the slicing planes
rise fast   and one speeds east   with her “remains”
14
Back among   her belongings   her remains
glide north northwest   in a shiny   SUV
designed to weather snowstorms   freezing rains
far from the simmering   fields   of Sicily
the East Coast cemetery’s stony   pressed
into a cleft   of hills   black ice   I skid on
leaning to greet the freckled   hearty   priest
looking   not looking at the box   she’s laid in
at the edge of the polished   boards   that hold her husband
the priest   says the words   she scorned   she didn’t believe
(she has to be blessed   to belong   to holy ground)
and O she would   scold us   if she were still alive!
no Tuono di dio   no bolt   so fierce and true
as the light of her mind   that felt   that thought   that knew

Sunday, 12 May 1833



The clouds are marshalling across the sky, Leaving their deepest tints upon yon range Of soul-alluring hills. The breeze comes softly, Laden with tribute that a hundred orchards Now in their fullest blossom send, in thanks For this refreshing shower. The birds pour forth In heightened melody the notes of praise They had suspended while God’s voice was speaking, And his eye flashing down upon his world. I sigh, half-charmed, half-pained. My sense is living, And, taking in this freshened beauty, tells Its pleasure to the mind. The mind replies, And strives to wake the heart in turn, repeating Poetic sentiments from many a record Which other souls have left, when stirred and satisfied By scenes as fair, as fragrant. But the heart Sends back a hollow echo to the call Of outward things, — and its once bright companion, Who erst would have been answered by a stream Of life-fraught treasures, thankful to be summoned, — Can now rouse nothing better than this echo; Unmeaning voice, which mocks their softened accents. Content thee, beautiful world! and hush, still busy mind! My heart hath sealed its fountains. To the things Of Time they shall be oped no more. Too long, Too often were they poured forth: part have sunk Into the desert; part profaned and swollen By bitter waters, mixed by those who feigned They asked them for refreshment, which, turned back, Have broken and o’erflowed their former urns. So when ye talk of pleasure, lonely world, And busy mind, ye ne’er again shall move me To answer ye, though still your calls have power To jar me through, and cause dull aching here. No so the voice which hailed me from the depths Of yon dark-bosomed cloud, now vanishing Before the sun ye greet. It touched my centre, The voice of the Eternal, calling me To feel his other worlds; to feel that if I could deserve a home, I still might find it In other spheres, — and bade me not despair, Though ‘want of harmony’ and ‘aching void’ Are terms invented by the men of this, Which I may not forget.                                  In former times I loved to see the lightnings flash athwart The stooping heavens; I loved to hear the thunder Call to the seas and mountains; for I thought ‘Tis thus man’s flashing fancy doth enkidle The firmament of mind; ‘tis thus his eloquence   Calls unto the soul’s depths and heights; and still I defied the creature, nor remembered The Creator in his works.                                     Ah now how different! The proud delight of that keen sympathy Is gone; no longer riding on the wave, But whelmed beneath it: my own plans and works, Or, as the Scriptures phrase it, my ’inventions’ No longer interpose ‘twist me and Heaven. Today, for the first time, I felt the Deity, And uttered prayer on hearing thunder. This Must be thy will, — for finer, higher spirits Have gone through this same process, — yet I think There was religion in that strong delight, Those sounds, those thoughts of power imparted. True, I did not say, ‘He is the Lord thy God,’ But I had feeling of his essence. But ‘’Twas pride by which the angels fell.’ So be it! But O, might I but see a little onward! Father, I cannot be a spirit of power; May I be active as a spirit of love, Since thou hast ta’en me from that path which Nature Seemed to appoint, O, deign to ope another, Where I may walk with thought and hope assured; ‘Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!’ Had I but faith like that which fired Novalis, I too could bear that the heart ‘fall in ashes,’ While the freed spirit rises from beneath them, With heavenward-look, and Phoenix-plumes upsoaring!

                    Conversation 4: On Place
                ","
I sit in my own shadow, she says, the way my mother gave birth to it. In artificial light, blinds drawn against the darkness of power.  I think of you as if you were that shadow, a natural enclosure, a world, not a slight, so I can wander through your darkness. Has our contract inverted time, made our universe contract, a cramped bed for two? And when I say your name, do I draw water, a portrait, curtain, bridge, or conclusion?
Place there is none, he quotes. Not even to hang up our archetypes. Let alone Star-Spangled Banners. We go forward and backward, and there is no place. Therefore it is a name for God. My eye, steadfast on traffic lights, abolishes the larger part of the round world. I should look at my feet. Space sweeps through us, a hell of distances bathed in the feeble glow of emptiness. Outward mobility, unimpeded. Suddenly we’re nobody home, without any need of inattention, imposture, or talent for deceit.
The wind whips my skin as if it were water, she says. My skin is water. For wind read wind, news, sky falling. Is it a mental disturbance or the higher math of love if I hear you talking under my breath and from the torn fragments assume the sun is far away and small, and a look can cause a burn? Superstition, too, is a kind of understanding, and to forgo it may have consequences.
Clusters of possibilities whiz through our head, he says. Electric charges, clogged highway, screeching brakes, a house too full of guests. With grounds for disagreement and miscarriage. The light rushes in dry, screaming. But the opaque parts of the nerve oppose the noise and void the options. Then the project must be prolonged in terms of lack.

                    Conversation 9: On Varieties of Oblivion
                ","
After bitter resistance the river unravels into the night, he says. Washes our daily fare of war out into a dark so deaf, so almost without dimension there is no word to dive from. Body weight displaced by dreams whose own lack promises lucidity so powerful it could shoot a long take to mindlessness. Fish smell travels the regions of sleep, westward like young men and the dawn. Then I return, too early to bring anything back, unsure of what I want, terrified I’ll fail, by a hair, to seize it.
We talk because we can forget, she says. Our bodies open to the dark, and sand runs out. Oblivion takes it all with equal tenderness. As the sea does. As the past. Already it suffuses the present with more inclusive tonalities. Not orchestrating a melodic sequence, but rounding the memory of a rooster on top a hanging silence. Or injured flesh. Impersonal. Only an animal could be so.
 
An avatar of the holy ghost, he chuckles. Or the angel of the annunciation beating his wings against a door slammed shut. Behind it, love already plays the organ. Without the angel. He is invisible because we have rejected his message.
On the old photos, she says, I see a stranger staking out my skin. As if an apple could fall too far from the tree. Yet I call her “me,” “my” years of furtively expanding flesh, with almost-certainty. It’s a belief that seems exempt from doubt, as if it were the hinge on which my doubts and questions turn. Still, I may seem the same “I” to you while I’ve already rolled it through the next door. From left to right.

You could grow into it,  that sense of living like a dog,  loyal to being on your own in the fur of your skin,  able to exist only for the sake of existing.  Nothing inside your head lasting long enough for you to hold onto,  you watch your own thoughts leap across your own synapses and disappear— small boats in a wind,         fliers in all that blue,                 the swish of an arm backed with feathers,  a dress talking in a corner,                 and then poof,         your mind clean as a dog’s,  your body big as the world,         important with accident—                blood or a limp, fur and paws.  You swell into survival,         you take up the whole day,  you’re all there is,         everything else is  not you, is every passing glint, is         shadows brought to you by wind,                 passing into a bird’s cheep, replaced by a                                rabbit skittering across a yard,  a void you yourself fall into.  You could make this beautiful,         but you don’t need to,  living is this fleshy side of the bone,         going on is this medicinal smell of the sun—                no dog ever tires of seeing his life  keep showing up at the back door  even as a rotting bone with a bad smell;  feet tottering, he dreams of it,  wakes and licks no matter what.

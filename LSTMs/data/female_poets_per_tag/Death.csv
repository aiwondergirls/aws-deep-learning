I saw you fall to the ground.
I saw the oaks fall.  The clouds collapsed.
I saw a wildness twist through your limbs

rose to the surface ice—nothing moved.

Because a lie is not a lie if the teller

the eighth-floor window,

on fire being smothered in blankets.
 
She asks me if she knows anyone
who got dead in a fire, anyone who
 got fired. When will I die? she asks.
When I was a child, I churched
 
my hands, I steepled my hands,
and all the people were inside,

a child. When I die, will you
 still love me? she asks. The mother
cracked on the pavement—

1.
Here I rest, in South Georgia.
A few feet of evolution away
lie the graves of whale hunters, pointing north.
A white fence shields them from elephant seals
and their apocalyptic screams that each day warn
of the end of the world, or maybe the beginning. . .
 
I survived five expeditions to the Pole.
The one before last, “Imperial Trans-Antarctica,” nearly killed me.
For two years I put up with the ice—no man can reap or sow
       these fields.
And, unlike farmers, I didn’t even need to ask God for rain,
because ice is sated
and more desolate than the Sahara.
 
I survived distance. Wrote one message after another
beginning with a capital letter and a ""PS."" at the end.
My own personal post office under my pillow
closed for two years already, on holiday.
 
I survived six month-long polar days and nights;
to this day, I don't know which one was worse.
 
My epitaph is simple. Carved in granite:
                         FRANK WILD
                         18 April 1873
                         19 August 1939
                         “Shackleton’s
                          Right Hand Man”
From those cast away here
by a defect in the engine of the ship
or nostalgia of the womb.
 
2.
Ah yes. . . in the beginning was the ship. The ship stuck in ice.
      Endurance. 
Ships are women. They prefer soft seas.
In the best-case scenario, she’s called La Santa Maria 
and she throws you, like Columbus, on some foreign shore.
 
But if you get too close to her. . .
 
The very day after
we washed her deck with warm water and soap,
warmed her arteries with gin,
stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs,
shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces,
she took off.
 
And from the shore,
we saw how she broke her ribs, sinking,
aft first, so fast we didn’t even have time to pray,
leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance
and faux pearls on the water.
 
“Such a woman!” someone laughed bitterly,
“She knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten.”
 
3.
A woman, naturally, has no business there.
Antarctica is a masculine continent—
male penguins keep the eggs warm,
the moon stands up on the street to urinate
after being kicked out of the tavern,
the cold like a cut-throat razor, dulled for three thousand years,
and the sled dogs, the Huskies,
we kill with a single bullet
so they won’t starve to death. In this way
we instill a little character into the new land
before the arrival of Conquistadors, thieves,
assassins, missionaries, prostitutes,
the first invading army of every continent.
 
Antarctica is a man’s continent,
because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind
by conquering the body,
as Amundsen and Scott did, their glory
reaching to the apex of ecstasy.
Zero degree of geographical latitude,
utter collapse.
 
4.
Hunger is overestimated. The stomach functions much like the
     brain:
when it has nothing to think about, it feeds off memories.
It can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit.
But those who have a better memory, meaning a much stronger
     acidity,
can go on for months
remembering a slice of prosciutto, two fried eggs,
sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal.
 
Then hallucinations begin. Banquets. Easter supper.
Feet move impatiently under the table;
the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter
and two clean serving hands with burns here and there.
That's when you feel grief-stricken
and you attack the seals and penguins with your
alpine knives and shoes like a madman
in an empty amphitheater.
Or is this, too, a hallucination,
and in this case not ours
but Antarctica's?
 
And when clarity finally returns,
both stomach and brain
notice only their own deep wrinkles.
 
 
5.
Blubber, blubber, seal's blubber.
Blubber that keeps your spirits alive, rendering it for fuel, for light,
blubber to mask the body's foul odor,
—a mixture of doubt, hope, and ammonia.
And if you have nothing better to do,
think of a cow's thigh hanging at the butcher's,
its delicate streak of fat
like a silk ribbon.
 
I survived even this sarcasm.
 
And every night, before bed,
we read recipes to each other
one of a few things we secretly rescued
from the ship before she sank,
as if these items were her lingerie.
 
What a show it was!
What pathos in pronouncing prosciutto, sugar, omelet!
What sensuality in milk, parsley, cinnamon!
We made these words up ourselves.
Nothing exists until its moment of absence.
 
But first, in order to warm up our mouths
like actors before going on stage,
we'd repeat mechanically, palates dry,
""Bless us, O Lord,
and this food we've received through your mercy.”
 
 
6.
It was the Romans who spoiled the word
studying rhetoric
before anatomy and mathematics:Vir bonus dicendi peritus
“The good man skilled in speaking"" (Marcus Porcius Cato)
 
But in Antarctica, words are measured differently: by calories!
With a simple greeting you lose five calories,
just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute.
And a Ciceronian argument can consume a whole day’s
      nutrition;
think carefully before you open your mouth.
 
The word is overestimated.
 
Sometimes it’s enough to avert your eyes from your shoes
to imply “gangrene”;
and a vague exchange of glances between men
is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet
and death is closer than your fingers.
 
7.
Stretched smooth from end to end—such is Antarctica. In fact,
even a baby’s skin looks withered by comparison.  
No emotions. No regrets. No warnings.
Either fight or die.
 
My father was like this more or less. A teacher at a village school.
In classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers
drying on the body. And eyes that moved freely
in their hollows, like toes
inside an older sibling’s shoes.
 
Unlike the Romans,
my father preached about justice and honor
his hands folded behind his back.
His shoulders seemed twice as wide
as his worn jacket.
 
I inherited his sharp, gray gaze
and his soft voice.
Eyes that say “Go” and a voice that says “Stay.”
You never know which one to trust.
 
 
8.
And mother? Oh, she was simply Captain Cook’s niece,
—the great James Cook—
from morning to night
when she washed, swept, dug potatoes from the garden,
fixed her husband’s tie on Sundays
even from her bed, while in labor.
She never spoke of this. As it wasn’t necessary.
People speak of what they have, not what they are.
 
She was a tailor. Measured everyone's perimeter with a glance;
erred only on the width of one’s neck, an unknown strength.
Her large scissors followed
the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely. ""Snip!""
She said little. Her silence followed the white outlines
of another tailor,
over a fabric much older than she was.
 
But now that I think of it,
how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking,
""Where is your son?""
""He's exploring the world.""
""And what does he bring back from there?""
""Himself, alive, I hope.""
""What's the point of returning empty-handed after two years?”
 
Was she at least a little proud of me? Of her Frank?
Certainly not. She was Captain Cook's niece.
The past always conquers.
 
 
9.
I was the first of thirteen children.
And as a rule, each of them
eyed one of my belongings.
One eyed my bed near the window
that overlooked the water where frogs lived
and asparagus grew on the shore.
Another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money,
poker cards, a fishing net,
my wicker chair with the damaged back.
Another whistled my favorite tune:
""What Will We Do with a Drunken Sailor?”
without reaching the refrain.
And yet another envied the basement
—that place I occupied in my father’s heart—
 with its elm door hanging by a single hinge.
 
But the time hasn't come to leave home just yet,
until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit
and dreams of the same girl.
 
 
10.
What shaving kit? Antarctica makes you grow a double-beard
as if you were a hundred-year-old grave.
And, while you remember wasting time waiting in line at
      barber's
another beard grows, a red one.
 
Here, each body part works for itself:
the stomach, hands, intestines, eyes. . .
The unity of the body is overestimated, too.
 
Only skin pulls everything together like a sled.
The skin? Which skin? Man loses his first skin
to his first love, like the snake early in spring
on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way.
From that point on he stops counting the rest.
 
11. 
I don’t know why it was named “Elephant Island,”
when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf.
We could only make out her sly teats under her belly. After
      some time,
if she didn’t kill us first, we’d begin to cry like wolves ourselves.
 
Twenty-two people. Packed next to one another under two
      inverted boats
like notes in Bach’s “Come, Sweet Death, Come Blessed Rest,”
with more pauses, a dramatic suffocation between breaths.
A dry, calcic cough was a sign of life. Or the delirious mutterings
        of someone
dreaming aloud of “ice” in the middle of ice,
after they had cut off his toes.
 
But the hardest moment arrives in the morning,
when, with shut eyes and plugged nostrils,
as if drinking your own urine
you recycle the same lie for four months straight:
“Men, pack up your stuff! The boss might arrive today!”
 
And they obeyed me. Packed carefully each day from the start,
leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags,
nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction.
 
It was a time when
routine grew more powerful than hope.
 
 
12.
Fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship.
On the seventh mile, we left our medals behind, class ranks,
along with the dogs, potatoes, and a camera.
We made fire out of money
and kept only a single metal coin each
so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later.
On Elephant Island, we had to bid farewell even to tobacco,
tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways
and walks home after midnight.
 
Time glided above us without touching a single strand of our
     hair—
nonexistent, as if gliding above ancient cities,
exposing the solemnity of our white bones
and crickets on absent walls.
 
That’s when the ten commandments deserted us:
“Do not steal,” “Do not lie,” “Do not covet,”
“Honor your parents”. . .
save one of them perhaps,
the one about the holiness of Sunday.
 
We already had nothing. We belonged to no one.
An entirely new species: HOMO ANTARCTICUS.
A scientific proof that “forgotten” and “free”
mean the same thing.
 
 
13.
Two years after returning from the world of the dead,
you find your house taken over by another tenant
and the rent tripled,
the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate:
“Here lived F.W.”
And your lover, or better, ex-lover,
for the same reason,
in the arms of another
three times more handsome.
 
You see your own image sold at an auction.
Artifact. Original. “Brrramp. Sold!” The price so high
you can’t afford it. But even if you could,
you're an illegal customer,
holding a death certificate in your hand.
 
And you find your parents turned into winter trees
their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster.
They don’t expect visitors. Best not disturb them.
Let their leaves fall quietly where they will
let the crow's nest remain in the armpit of a branch,
where it has always been.
 
Perhaps you should take a shortcut, start over.
Or you know what? There’s a war going on nearby, they say.
Go there instead!
But this time die better.
 
 
14.
War’s never satisfied with flesh;
Fresh, branded, smoked,
with or without blood
blue blood, dark, thick, whatever kind.
And frozen blood like yours
could store at minus 40 degrees Celsius,
viruses from 1914 unscathed,
and the map of the old Empire         
and Scott's hurt ego 
and old coins minted with the head of Edward VII,
and Browning’s poetry and the epic of the unknown,
like an envelope inside an envelope,
all making you the ideal candidate.
 
Back on the ship, ammunition everywhere,
sailing through the cold Northern seas
where you had to learn a new language.
A new language is like a fish:
first, you need to remove its spine
in order to chew it.
 
Unlike in Antarctica,
one’s purpose in war is clear: kill or be killed,
though sometimes it’s the same difference.
 
Baltic nights gave you what Antarctica refused you:
the other half of the celestial sphere.
You meet Vera, the widow of a tea plantation owner,
a character out of a Baroque novel, her pupils blurred with dusk,
and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body
like a final journey. 
 
 
15.
A man charmed by a glacier,
who knows too well the flawless forms of her body,
feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep,
her clean and distant breath
and her heart, a piece of ice, that melts inside a cigarette case
heated for drinking water,
finds it difficult to marry a real woman,
to marry Vera.
And Africa.
 
I bought land. Barren. Hundreds of acres. In Zululand.
I didn’t fare well with tobacco. Planted cotton instead,
chose bodily peace rather than meditation.
My nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away. White, of course.
And my fate, never blended with the blacks,
those beautiful statues, wrapped in straw.
I heard them nod off during lunch break,
like the oars of a boat,
in complete sync.
They knew where they were heading.
But I didn’t.
 
And I was right. It didn’t take long
before drought, floods, worms
destroyed everything. The bank left me only my own beard
and the malarial shadow of a baobab. Apart from other things,
Vera filled out divorce papers. The woman in the yellow dress,
yellow as quinine, yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk,
the woman married to the hero
who now can’t even manage a small plot of land.
 
 
16.
The man in front of me
—my master I call ""Boss""—
is newly shaved, and dressed in a striped tie and jacket
as if the Prince of Wales or Fred Astaire,
a style that arrives here two years late.
He asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar
and chat them up
using their jargon, gestures,
sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes,
and the abstract rhetoric of the Depression years.
And, to be frank,
he pays me for the latter.
 
But what do I know,
what does a survivor know about the art of living,
for which new instincts are needed, new muscles
and other kinds of heart valves?
 
Furthermore,
how can I obey such a spick-and-span boss,
having known the smoky gods of Antarctica
who recognize each other solely by the nose
and can end rebellions with a glance
and count the deaths as members of the crew?
How can I take orders from a boss whose name isn't Shackleton?
 
 
17.
""Second in command,” “Lieutenant,” “Shackleton’s right hand”
 
What did she see so clearly in me,
my drama teacher in elementary school
when she'd always assign me the role of Father Joseph,
of Gaspar the Magi offering Jesus frankincense,
or of John the Baptist always there to clear the path?
What did she see in my metallic pupils, baritone voice,
      infrequent speech
as if scissors, bandage, and iodine
inside a first aid kit?
 
Under Antarctica's naked sky, each of us followed his own star.
Even the carpenter, his own heraldic calling.
You didn’t need much to feed them;
 just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents' punctured holes.
 
My star was weak; you could hardly see it
hidden behind another larger, troubled star
like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks
more attractive when absent.
 
 
18.
What happened afterward can be told in a few words:
I worked in a mine; earth’s warm heart,
happened to be crueler than her frozen brain.
I laid railroad tracks South, always toward the Unknown.
It was like playing only two strings on a violin: joy and sorrow,
fatefully blending at the horizon.
 
I repaired houses. Another waste of time.
I never understood their weak points,
just as you can't make out eyes from genitals or mouth
in some underwater creatures.
 
And when I was left penniless,
I gave lectures about Antarctica,
water gurgling in my gullet every five words, for those few
who listened patiently to an adventure of survival.
 
Then Bea arrived. Or sweet Beatrice.
It was easy to grant her what I had left in my heart
—that set of heavy museum keys—
with no fear she might lose them.
 
Tired lungs and liver
could barely follow my split image
of bust and bottle of booze.
Like a prophet in the last circle of Dante’s Inferno,
I carried my own decapitated head in hand.
 
My ashes were lost at the base of a church. No one
      thought of them.

                ","
The woman at the Salvation Army who sorts and prices is in her eighties
and she underestimates the value of everything, for which I am grateful.
 
Lightly used snow suits, size 2T, are $6 and snow boots are $3.
 
There is a little girl, maybe seven, fiddling with a tea set. Her mother
inspects drapes for stains.
 
Sometimes the very old and lonely are looking for an opening.
 
She glances up from her pricing and says something about the tea set
and a baby doll long ago.
 
I am careful not to make eye contact, but the mother with drapes has
such softness in her shoulders and her face and she knows how to say
the perfect kind thing—“What a wonderful mother you had.”
 
“Yes, she was.”
 
Why do children sometimes notice us and sometimes not?
 
From the bin of dolls: “What happened to your mother?”
 
“She died.”
 
The woman at the Salvation Army who sorts and prices is crying a little.
She seems surprised to be crying. “It’s been eighty years and I still miss
her.”
 
When my daughter was born I couldn’t stop thinking about how we
were going to die. If we were drowning, would it be better to hold her
to me even as she fought away or should I let her float off to wonder why
her mother didn’t help her? What if it’s fire and I have one bullet left? I
made sure my husband knew if there were death squads and he had to
choose, I’d never love him again if he didn’t choose her. If I’m lucky,
her crying face is the last thing I’ll see.
 
The mother with drapes is squeezing her daughter’s shoulder, trying to
send a silent message, but children are children. “Why did she die?”
 
“She was going to have a baby and—And she died.”
 
“But she was a wonderful mother.”
 
I’m holding a stack of four wooden jigsaw puzzles of farm animals,
dinosaurs, jungle animals, and pets. Each for a quarter.
 
“It’s silly how much I still miss her.” She takes out a tissue and wipes
her eyes and then her nose.
 
When my grandmother threw her sister, Susie, a 90th birthday party,
one hundred people came, including 5 of the 6 brothers and sisters. At
dusk only a few of us were left, nursing beers with our feet kicked up
on the bottom rungs of various walkers.
 
Susie said then to my grandmother, “Can you think of all the people
watching us in heaven now? And our mother must be in the front row.”
 
Grandma took her sister’s hand. “Our mother—Estelle.”
 
“Yes—her name was Estelle. I forgot that.”
 
They looked so happy then, saying her name back and forth to each
other. Estelle. Estelle.

                    When Black Men Drown Their Daughters
                ","
When black, men drown. They spend their whole lifetimes
justifying the gall of springing the trap, the inconvenience
of slouched denim, of coupling beyond romance or aim.
All the while, the rising murk edges toward their chins.
Hurriedly, someone crafts another scientific tome, a giddy
exploration of the curious dysfunction identifying black
men first as possible, then as necessary. Elegant equations
succumb to a river that blurs quotient and theory, rendering
them unreadable, and the overwhelm easily disappears
the men, their wiry heads glistening, then gulped. All that’s
left is the fathers’ last wisdom, soaked wreckage on silver:Girl, that water ain’t nothing but wet. I’m gon’ be alright.
 
When black men drown, their daughters turn to their mothers
and ask What should I do with this misnamed shiver in myleft shoulder? How should I dress in public? They are weary
of standing at the shore, hands shading their eyes, trying
to make out their own fathers among the thousands bobbing
in the current. The mothers mumble and point to any flailing
that seems familiar. Mostly, they’re wrong. Buoyed by church
moans and comfort food of meat and cream, the daughters
try on other names that sound oddly broken when pressed
against the dank syllables of the fathers’. Drained, with justforward in mind, they walk using the hip of only one parent.
They scratch in their sleep. Black water wells up in the wound.
 
When black men drown, their daughters are fascinated with
the politics of water, how gorgeously a surface breaks
to receive, how it weeps so sanely shut. And the thrashing
of hands, shrieking of names: I was Otis, I was Willie Earl,they called me Catfish. Obsessed by the waltzing of tides,
the daughters remember their fathers—the scorch of beard
electrifying the once-in-a-while kiss, the welts in thick arms,
eyes wearied with so many of the same days wedged behind
them. When black men drown, their daughters memorize all
the steps involved in the deluge. They know how long it takes
for a weakened man to dissolve. A muted light, in the shape
of a little girl, used to be enough to light a daddy’s way home.
 
When black men drown, their daughters drag the water’s floor
with rotting nets, pull in whatever still breathes. They insist their
still-dripping daddies sit down for cups of insanely sweetened
tea, sniffs of rotgut, tangled dinners based on improbable swine.
The girls hope to reacquaint their drowned fathers with the concept
of body, but outlines slosh in drift and retreat. The men can’t get
dry. Parched, they scrub flooded hollows and weep for water
to give them name and measure as mere blood once did. Knocking
over those spindly-legged dinette chairs, they interrupt the failed
feast and mutter Baby girl, gotta go, baby gotta go, their eyes
misted with their own murders. Grabbing their girls, they spit
out love in reverse and stumble toward the banks of some river.
 
When black men drown their daughters, the rash act is the only
plausible response to the brain’s tenacious mouth and its dare: Yes, yes, open your ashed hands and release that wingless child. Note
the arc of the sun-drenched nosedive, the first syllable of the child’s
name unwilling from the man’s mouth, the melody of billow that
begins as blessed clutch. Someone crouching inside the father waits
impatiently for the shutting, the lethargic envelop, and wonders if
the daughter’s wide and realizing eye will ever close to loose him.
It never will, and the man and his child and the daughter and her
father gaze calmly into the wrecked science of each other’s lives.
The sun struggles to spit a perfect gold upon the quieting splash.
The river pulses stylish circles of its filth around the swallow.

A mother possum crawled down the chimney
the spring Donny came to us

the same April after your dad and I divorced
when you kicked a hole in the dining room wall.
The possum was swollen with young
she would later carry, half-grown, on her back

“An oversized rat with maternal instincts,”
your dad once said.
 
Instead of one angry son, I now had two–
fifteen and seventeen–
two forged signatures on absence excuses,
two discipline committee meetings,
two conferences with the principal.
While I worked,
you shared contraband beer,
as well as the basement bedroom
with its fieldstone fireplace
in which you found the possum one cool evening.
 
Laughing and cheering, you teamed up
to cage her with a trash can,
carry her to the alley out back and dump her.
The possum squeezed back
down the chimney twice more. The third time
you threw her out on Troost Avenue, screaming
for a car to smash her beneath its tires.
She must have been near her time,
desperate for a nest,
to crawl back down after that.
The noise woke me after midnight.
Donny had clubbed her with his nunchuks.
You both kicked and stomped
her head as she lurched, stumbled
between your feet.
Halfway down
the basement steps I stopped,
seeing your faces. The possum fell
limp. I backed slowly up the stairs.
 
In the morning, you couldn’t meet my eyes.
I just made you clean up the mess.

                ","
Ours was a play-filled childhood; irrigation ditches ran deep
during the summers. We played in the water and dirt, then inscribed
ABCs and numbers onto the smooth ground. Our cat Polly died
of rabies; then all the pets had to be shot, some in the rib cage
as they thrashed in panic. There was a pink bruise
on my forehead from pressing against the wall. We couldn't figure
 
out how such a thing could happen. The dogs were steadfast figures
around the farm. They chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep
panic among visitors and passersby. They had cuts and bruises
from scuffles with roaming packs. No tags were inscribed
with their random Navajo names. Snazzy was skinny; his rib cage
obvious through thin fur. He looked as if he might die
 
from hunger, but he ate like nobody's business. Who knew he would die
of rabies with the rest? The main thing was to figure
out how they contracted it, my parents said. We cried until our rib cages
ached; our eyes stayed swollen. This first loss was too deep
to even talk about. Decades later, I can finally describe
how that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise
 
that would last forever. But our neighbor suffered worse bruises:
their huge dog, named Dog, was the first to die
and was the cause of all this. Their home and fields are inscribed
in our memories as ""the rabies place."" Over time, they must have figured
it was too much to live down. Childhood losses run deep,
even though we are grandparents now. The memory is an invisible cage
 
of anguished sobs, gunshots, yelping howls, canine rib cages
exploding. Sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises
of grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars. That initial deep
hurt was the start, we found, of how love could die
right before us, even as we watched: stunned figures
pleading for mercy, urgent prayers saying, ""Let God's scribe
 
mark this down. We've paid our dues. Our hearts are inscribed
with loss after loss."" For some reason, after everything, our rib cages
held up and continued to cradle tender hearts. They must have figured
that all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises
that would weaken us. Our love for those homely animals was deep
 
and would figure in the knowledge that such bruises
aren't endless, and that our rib cages are not mere bones. One can die
from grief, so now we can describe loss and love as the Holy Twins.

 Nihideezhí, it was a moist June afternoon when we buried you.
The Oak Springs Valley was dense with sage, cedar, and chamisa;
and gray, green, and brown shrubs cradled the small cemetery.
The sky was huge overhead.
Your son said later, ""Did you see the sky? It was purple.
I knew it would rain,"" he said.
 
The dark Carrizo Mountains were so clear.
 
There were so many people, Sister.
Many of your friends whom we didn't know,
and your former schoolmates whom we remembered as children,
and Sister, we met many relatives for the first time.
 
We cried, not wanting to leave you in that serene place.
We hesitated, though our father, his parents, and their parents
are buried there. Our older sisters thought ahead to bring flowers for them.
They huddled quietly over their graves a few feet away.
 
Shideezhí, remember how red the sand is?
The men—your sons, our nephews, grandsons, and various in-laws—
took turns filling your grave. Their necks and arms were streaked
with dusty sweat. They kept their heads down;
their faces were damp and eyes, swollen.
 
We had to get it all out; we cried
and held each other. My granddaughters hovered near me
as if I might faint or fall unexpectedly.
 
Did you see, Sister, the way the grandchildren fed and served everyone?
They guided the grandparents and the elderly to their chairs.
Once seated, they served plates filled with mutton ribs,
potato salad, corn, thick slabs of oven bread, crispy fry bread,
and Jell-O salad. They placed the salt and pepper—that enduring couple—
before us and implored us to eat. The two delights we relished were good—
hot, strong coffee and cold, crisp diet pop.
 
We ate for you; we consumed your meal, Shideezhí.
We ate to honor the times you cooked for us—
those tasty dishes, scrumptious pastries combined with laughter,
silly childhood memories, and always teasing jokes.

Wehaven't. But when I read about not-there.org and saw its flashy graphics,I wasn't thinking about how women are not-there-yet, metaphorically, I just thought about women who are really not there, women and girls whokeep disappearing (not from magazines, who don't make news in Manhattan)like they've evaporated, like illusions, hundreds in Juárez, twelve hundred missing and murdered Native women across Canada. The hands of men.Now you see her. Not. Not-there. Not here, either,or anywhere.

After a while the 500-year-old village became a secret,carved into the wall of the forest where it met the Pacific,eleven long houses and their racks of drying fish, theirdogs. No roads to this town, only boats and the memory ofboaters. Blankets made from woodpecker feathers, cattailfluff, cedar bark and dog hair woven into a plaid pattern.At least that's what I remember of the museum's diorama.When the mud came down the mountain and covered the village, no one had lived there for years. It was a boaterwho remembered, after a while, that the village was gone,and also that it had once existed. Archaeologists broughtgarden hoses to wash the mud off and hooked the hoses upto the sea. Some of what had been preserved in the mudwas destroyed that day by the water pressure, and then latermost else was ruined by the wind and rain, but at least fora few weeks they could hold the bones in their hands. Thearchaeologists brought their dogs, they lived there a while.

After the birthing of bombs of forks and fear
the frantic automatic weapons unleashed,
the spray of bullets into a crowd holding hands,
that brute sky opening in a slate metal maw
that swallows only the unsayable in each of us, what’s
left? Even the hidden nowhere river is poisoned
orange and acidic by a coal mine. How can
you not fear humanity, want to lick the creek
bottom dry, to suck the deadly water up into
your own lungs, like venom? Reader, I want to
say: Don’t die. Even when silvery fish after fish
comes back belly up, and the country plummets
into a crepitating crater of hatred, isn’t there still
something singing? The truth is: I don’t know.
But sometimes, I swear I hear it, the wound closing
like a rusted-over garage door, and I can still move
my living limbs into the world without too much
pain, can still marvel at how the dog runs straight
toward the pickup trucks break-necking down
the road, because she thinks she loves them,
because she’s sure, without a doubt, that the loud
roaring things will love her back, her soft small self
alive with desire to share her goddamn enthusiasm,
until I yank the leash back to save her because
I want her to survive forever. Don’t die, I say,
and we decide to walk for a bit longer, starlings
high and fevered above us, winter coming to lay
her cold corpse down upon this little plot of earth.
Perhaps we are always hurtling our body towards
the thing that will obliterate us, begging for love
from the speeding passage of time, and so maybe,
like the dog obedient at my heels, we can walk together
peacefully, at least until the next truck comes.

2  The Miniature Bed
A miniature bed, and in it two tiny people
not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,
like a match, the sun's flaring.     
3  Harvest
 
The fields are a book of uses.
Near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
Dust rises up and replaces itself.
A quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.
 
In the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
We flourish.
All around us, things flourish.
Cows strain the fence with their abundance.
The herd makes a sound like swelling.
 
Out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth.     
4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth
 
The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
It was August, haying season. My tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school
for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn
I watched him shoot the calf in the head.
He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't
have to get married. I let my feet go black
from burned grasses. It never gets easier
he said, kicking straw over the blood patch.
She went down so quiet it was almost
sad. Later, when my tooth fell out, I buried it
under my pillow and it grew into money.     
5  Talisman
 
Waiting for the school bus you find
the femur of a baby animal
on the ground. You carry
that femur in your pocket
the entire morning and touch it
secretly through the cloth.
When the teacher asks
a question you don't raise
your hand but quietly
wrap your fingers around
the thin shape, that bone
without a mother.     
6  On Waking
 
Half of everything is invisible.
A river drifts below the river.
A gesture lost in the body.
Wind moves through the open
windows of the trees.
 
Beyond the day, another day.
 
Dreamed I was drowning
my mother's silk laundry
in the river,
kneeling on the wet rocks.
Back and forth I drowned it
in the gray clouds...     
7  Eros
 
Each year fish run the green vein of the river.
The bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain.
 
From a fragment of a Greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
A skeleton has the same intelligence.
 
So that when a girl discovers it,
loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.     
8  A Childhood
 
The horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
He held still in the sunblazed pasture.
For a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.
He was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. He listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
A jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
Everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
The excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
As if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.

fattened into snow in the woods

cut trails and taught me to ski,
laying down the herringbone behind him

each run a victory of luck more than will,
each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
I wonder how it is for him now

the cold blank that’s ahead. When the whales
beached, spectators came like pilgrims,

keeps a record of each test and drug.

took her down the lantana path to the boat,
something she might like, he said –
 
Kristin was raped at times twice a day
or sometimes not for a week
and sometimes after it he gave her pocket
money once a twenty dollar bill which down
the gully later she tore into thin red strips and buried.
 
Back at the house her mother
bashed her for lying about the uncle,
who was her brother, and who had loaned them
the deposit on the house where Kristin and Odette
her sister were fortunate enough to live.
 
When Kristin grew up, her mother apologised to her.
The uncle was still alive. He had sent her a
Christmas card this year. She sat on the lounge,
looking down at her runners, her mouth closed.
Behind her the stereogram and Elvis, a silent witness.
 
The uncle had said she was a rude girl, she should
keep quiet about their secret otherwise
he’d give her little sister a taste of the same.
Kristin was quiet from then on. The reason she was
telling me now, her hand on my arm
 
was that last week she’d had a call from Odette
who was living in London.
The uncle during those primary
school years had done the same to her, tricked her
the same way, used the same words.
 
I feel the weight of my empty useless arms.
But later I hold her – hug her goodnight.
She touches my shoulder. I was convinced, she says,
I was saving my sister.
My head clatters: Virgin, May I help you?
 
Back in the Furies’ bunk-room it’s beauty night,
they’re whisking egg whites for a face mask …
After they’ve done each other they sit me on the bed
and paint my face with their fingers
the egg white sets quickly and they tell me not to smile.
 
I dream of Alecto’s iron tower and bloody clothes –
then I’m on TV being interviewed: So, the oldest Fury –
and who is your god? I am asked – I once served Artemis, I say.
And before that? – Athena, I say – Anath, Isis.
I do not mention Dionysis or the Thracian women.

Ay me, to whom shall I my case complain, That may compassion my impatient grief? Or where shall I unfold my inward pain, That my enriven heart may find relief?           Shall I unto the heavenly pow’rs it show,           Or unto earthly men that dwell below?   To heavens? Ah, they, alas, the authors were, And workers of my unremedied woe: For they foresee what to us happens here, And they foresaw, yet suffered this be so.           From them comes good, from them comes also ill,           That which they made, who can them warn to spill.   To men? Ah, they, alas, like wretched be, And subject to the heavens’ ordinance: Bound to abide whatever they decree. Their best redress is their best sufferance.           How then can they, like wretched, comfort me,           The which no less need comforted to be?   Then to myself will I my sorrow mourn,  Sith none alive like sorrowful remains: And to myself my plaints shall back return, To pay their usury with doubled pains.           The woods, the hills, the rivers shall resound           The mournful accent of my sorrow’s ground.   Woods, hills, and rivers now are desolate, Sith he is gone the which them all did grace: And all the fields do wail their widow state, Sith death their fairest flow’r did late deface.           The fairest flow’r in field that ever grew,           Was Astrophel; that was, we all may rue.   What cruel hand of cursed foe unknown, Hath cropped the stalk which bore so fair a flow’r? Untimely cropped, before it well were grown, And clean defaced in untimely hour.           Great loss to all that ever him did see,           Great loss to all, but greatest loss to me.   Break now your garlands, O ye shepherds’ lasses, Sith the fair flow’r, which them adorned, is gone: The flow’r, which them adorned, is gone to ashes, Never again let lass put garland on.           Instead of garland, wear sad cypress now,           And bitter elder, broken from the bough.   Ne ever sing the love-lays which he made: Who ever made such lays of love as he? Ne ever read the riddles, which he said Unto yourselves, to make you merry glee.             Your merry glee is now laid all abed,           Your merry maker now, alas, is dead.   Death, the devourer of all the world’s delight, Hath robbed you and reft from me my joy: Both you and me and all the world he quite Hath robbed of joyance, and left sad annoy.           Joy of the world, and shepherds’ pride was he,           Shepherds’ hope never like again to see.   O Death, that hast us of such riches reft, Tell us at least, what hast thou with it done? What is become of him whose flow’r here left Is but the shadow of his likeness gone:           Scarce like the shadow of that which he was,           Naught like, but that he like a shade did pass.   But that immortal spirit, which was decked With all the dowries of celestial grace: By sovereign choice from th’heavenly choirs select, And lineally derived from angels’ race,           Oh, what is now of it become, aread.           Ay me, can so divine a thing be dead?   Ah no: it is not dead, ne can it die,  But lives for aye, in blissful Paradise: Where like a new-born babe it soft doth lie, In bed of lilies wrapped in tender wise,           And compassed all about with roses sweet,           And dainty violets from head to feet.   There thousand birds all of celestial brood, To him do sweetly carol day and night: And with strange notes, of him well understood, Lull him asleep in angel-like delight;           Whilst in sweet dream to him presented be           Immortal beauties, which no eye may see.   But he them sees and takes exceeding pleasure Of their divine aspects, appearing plain, And kindling love in him above all measure, Sweet love still joyous, never feeling pain.           For what so goodly form he there doth see,           He may enjoy from jealous rancor free.   There liveth he in everlasting bliss, Sweet spirit never fearing more to die: Ne dreading harm from any foes of his, Ne fearing savage beasts’ more cruelty.           Whilst we here, wretches, wail his private lack,           And with vain vows do often call him back.   But live thou there still happy, happy spirit, And give us leave thee here thus to lament: Not thee that dost thy heaven’s joy inherit, But our own selves that here in dole are drent.           Thus do we weep and wail, and wear our eyes,           Mourning in other’s, our own miseries.

Bury your heart in some deep green hollow
     Or hide it up in a kind old tree;
Better still, give it the swallow
     When she goes over the sea.
 
In Saturday’s Market there’s eggs a ’plenty
     And dead-alive ducks with their legs tied down,
Grey old gaffers and boys of twenty—
     Girls and the women of the town—
Pitchers and sugar-sticks, ribbons and laces,
     Poises and whips and dicky-birds’ seed,
Silver pieces and smiling faces,
     In Saturday Market they’ve all they need.
 
What were you showing in Saturday Market
     That set it grinning from end to end
Girls and gaffers and boys of twenty—?
     Cover it close with your shawl, my friend—
Hasten you home with the laugh behind you,
     Over the down—, out of sight,
Fasten your door, though no one will find you,
     No one will look on a Market night.
 
See, you, the shawl is wet, take out from under
     The red dead thing—. In the white of the moon
On the flags does it stir again? Well, and no wonder!
     Best make an end of it; bury it soon.
If there is blood on the hearth who’ll know it?
     Or blood on the stairs,
When a murder is over and done why show it?
     In Saturday Market nobody cares.
      
Then lie you straight on your bed for a short, short weeping
     And still, for a long, long rest,
There’s never a one in the town so sure of sleeping
     As you, in the house on the down with a hole in your breast.
 
              Think no more of the swallow,
                     Forget, you, the sea,
     Never again remember the deep green hollow
                     Or the top of the kind old tree!

The room in Paris, the room at Geneva,
The little damp room with the seaweed smell,
And that ceaseless maddening sound of the tide—
     Rooms where for good or for ill—things died.
But there is the room where we (two) lie dead,

Here, in the darkness, where this plaster saint
       Stands nearer than God stands to our distress,
And one small candle shines, but not so faint
     As the far lights of everlastingness,

     Where Christ is hanging, rather pray
         To something more like my own clay,

Of earthliness on his shining wedding face;
And then gone suddenly blank and old
The hateful day of the divorce:
Stuart got his, hands down, of course
Crowing like twenty cocks and grinning like a horse:
But Monty took it hard. All said and done I liked him best,—
He was the first, he stands out clearer than the rest.

   The sight of my own face (for it was lovely then) even the scent of my own hair,
            Oh! there was nothing, nothing that did not sweep to the high seat
                     Of laughing gods, and then blow down and beat
   My soul into the highway dust, as hoofs do the dropped roses of the street.

And throwing out the youngest smile, shy, but half haughty and half sweet.

    When you remind them you are not precisely twenty-two—

That is not always true: there was my Mother (well at least the dead are free!)

                The little portress at the Convent School, stewing in hell so patiently;
The poor, fair boy who shot himself at Aix. And what of me—and what of me ?
                But I, I paid for what I had, and they for nothing. No, one cannot see

                 For every hour they slant across the hedge a different way,

                 Back to the fold, across the evening fields, like any flock of baa-ing sheep:
Yes, it may be, when He has shorn, led us to slaughter, torn the bleating soul in us to rags,
                                 For so He giveth His belovèd sleep.
                             Oh! He will take us stripped and done,
                             Driven into His heart. So we are won:
                  Then safe, safe are we? in the shelter of His everlasting wings—
                  I do not envy Him his victories, His arms are full of broken things.
 
                         But I shall not be in them. Let Him take
                                 The finer ones, the easier to break.
And they are not gone, yet, for me, the lights, the colours, the perfumes,
                         Though now they speak rather in sumptuous rooms.
                                          In silks and in gemlike wines;

                                          And overhead the lancet-window glows
                         With golds and crimsons you could almost drink 
To know how jewels taste, just as I used to think
There was the scent in every red and yellow rose

                                       And much too quiet. No one here,
                                       Why, this is awful, this is fear!
                                                  Nothing to see, no face.

                 No one to sit with, really, or to speak to, friend to friend:
                         Out of the long procession, black or white or red
Not one left now to say “Still I am here, then see you, dear, lay here your head”.
                         Only the doll’s house looking on the Park
                 To-night, all nights, I know, when the man puts the lights out, very dark.
With, upstairs, in the blue and gold box of a room, just the maids' footsteps overhead,
Then utter silence and the empty world—the room—the bed—
                                         The corpse! No, not quite dead, while this cries out in me.
                                                          But nearly: very soon to be

                                             Tell me there will be someone. Who?
                                        If there were no one else, could it be You?
 
                                        How old was Mary out of whom you cast
                 So many devils? Was she young or perhaps for years
She had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man going past
                 Till suddenly she saw You on the steps of Simon’s house
                                        And stood and looked at You through tears.
                                                     I think she must have known by those
                                        The thing, for what it was that had come to her.
                                        For some of us there is a passion, I suppose,
                                        So far from earthly cares and earthly fears
                                        That in its stillness you can hardly stir
                                                     Or in its nearness, lift your hand,
                                        So great that you have simply got to stand
                                        Looking at it through tears, through tears.
                                        Then straight from these there broke the kiss,
                                                    I think You must have known by this
                                        The thing, for what it was, that had come to You:
                                                    She did not love You like the rest,
                                         It was in her own way, but at the worst, the best,
                                                    She gave You something altogether new.
                                         And through it all, from her, no word,
                                                    She scarcely saw You, scarcely heard:
                                         Surely You knew when she so touched You with her hair,
                                                    Or by the wet cheek lying there,
And while her perfume clung to You from head to feet all through the day
                                         That You can change the things for which we care,
                                         But even You, unless You kill us, not the way.
 
                                         This, then was peace for her, but passion too.        
                                         I wonder was it like a kiss that once I knew,
                                              The only one that I would care to take
       Into the grave with me, to which if there were afterwards, to wake.
                                              Almost as happy as the carven dead
                                         In some dim chancel lying head by head
       We slept with it, but face to face, the whole night through—
One breath, one throbbing quietness, as if the thing behind our lips was endless life,
       Lost, as I woke, to hear in the strange earthly dawn, his “Are you there?”
                                   And lie still, listening to the wind outside, among the firs.
 
       So Mary chose the dream of Him for what was left to her of night and day,
It is the only truth: it is the dream in us that neither life nor death nor any other
                               thing can take away:
       But if she had not touched Him in the doorway of the dream could she have
                               cared so much ?
       She was a sinner, we are what we are: the spirit afterwards, but first the touch.
 
And He has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees
Of Eden and Calvary, with its ghosts that have not any eyes for tears,
And the happier guests who would not see, or if they did, remember these,

                                       Outside, too gravely looking at me. He seems to stand,
                                                    And looking at Him, if my forgotten spirit came

                                       Unwillingly back to the burden of old imaginings
                                       When it has learned so long not to think, not to be,
              Again, again it would speak as it has spoken to me of things

              I cannot bear to look at this divinely bent and gracious head:
                     When I was small I never quite believed that He was dead:
                         And at the Convent school I used to lie awake in bed
              Thinking about His hands. It did not matter what they said,
     He was alive to me, so hurt, so hurt! And most of all in Holy Week
                                      When there was no one else to see
                              I used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly,
                                               If He had ever seemed to notice me

Falling leaves and falling men!     When the snows of winter fall, And the winds of winter blows,     Will be woven Nature’s pall.   Let us, then, forsake our dead;     For the dead will surely wait While we rush upon the foe,     Eager for the hero’s fate.   Leaves will come upon the trees;     Spring will show the happy race; Mothers will give birth to sons—     Loyal souls to fill our place.   Wherefore should we rest and rush?     Soldiers, we must fight and save Freedom now, and give our foes     All their country should—a grave!

                    Giving Back the Flower
                ","
So, because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night,     And to stand in the half-set moon with the weird fall-light on your glimmering hair, Till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight,     And to give me a little scarlet bud, that was dying of frost, to wear,  Say, must you taunt me forever, forever? You looked at my hand and you knew     That I was the slave of the Ring, while you were as free as the wind is free. When I saw your corpse in your coffin, I flung back your flower to you;     It was all of yours that I ever had; you may keep it, and—keep from me.  Ah? so God is your witness. Has God, then, no world to look after but ours?     May He not have been searching for that wild stat, with the trailing plumage, that         flew Far over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers,     Or else brightening some planet’s luminous rings, instead of thinking of you?  Or, if He was near us at all, do you think that He would sit listening there     Because you sang “Hear me, Norma,” to a woman in jewels and lace, While, so close to us, down in another street, in the wet, unlighted air,     There were children crying for bread and fire, and mothers who questioned His         grace?  Or perhaps He had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day,     To number the bloody stabs that were there, to look at and judge the dead; Or else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay;     At least I do not believe that He cares to remember a word that you said.  So take back your flowers, I tell you—of its sweetness I now have no need;     Yes; take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep; When you wake I will take it, and God, then, perhaps will witness indeed,     But go, now, and tell Death he must watch you, and not let you walk in your sleep.

all the way to Ship Island. What we see
first is the fort, its roof of grass, a lee—
half reminder of the men who served there—
a weathered monument to some of the dead.
 
Inside we follow the ranger, hurried
though we are to get to the beach. He tells
of graves lost in the Gulf, the island split
in half when Hurricane Camille hit,
shows us casemates, cannons, the store that sells
souvenirs, tokens of history long buried.

in bronze; no names carved for the Native Guards—

Hopi men and women—brown, and small, and claylike

                  over the edge of a dinner table, the young Hopi men went
                         back to work cutting the land into large chunks of rust.
Nobody noticed at first—not the white workers,
     not the Indian workers—but in the mounds of dismantled mesa,
           among the clods and piles of sand,
                 lay the small gray bowls of babies’ skulls.
Not until they climbed to the bottom did they see
     the silvered bones glinting from the freshly sliced dirt-and-rock wall—
           a mausoleum mosaic, a sick tapestry: the tiny remains
                 roused from death’s dusty cradle, cut in half, cracked,
                        wrapped in time-tattered scraps of blankets.Let’s call it a day, the white foreman said.
     That night, all the Indian workers got sad-drunk—got sick
          —while Elders sank to their kivas in prayer. Next morning,
                as dawn festered on the horizon, state workers scaled the mesas,
                        knocked at the doors of pueblos that had them, hollered
                               into those without them,
demanding the Hopi men come back to work—then begging them—
     then buying them whiskey—begging again—finally sending their white
          wives up the dangerous trail etched into the steep sides
                to buy baskets from Hopi wives and grandmothers
                       as a sign of treaty.
When that didn’t work, the state workers called the Indians lazy,
      sent their sunhat-wearing wives back up to buy more baskets—
           katsinas too—then called the Hopis good-for-nothings, 
                 before begging them back once more.We’ll try again in the morning, the foreman said.
     But the Indian workers never returned—
          The bias and dots calls to work went unanswered,
                as the fevered Hopis stayed huddled inside.
The small bones half-buried in the crevices of mesa—
     in the once-holy darkness of silent earth and always-night—
          smiled or sighed beneath the moonlight, while white women
                in Airstream trailers wrote letters home
praising their husbands’ patience, describing the lazy savages:
     such squalor in their stone and plaster homes—cobs of corn stacked
         floor to ceiling against crumbling walls—their devilish ceremonies
               and the barbaric way they buried their babies,
                      oh, and those beautiful, beautiful baskets.

When my brother died
I worried there wasn’t enough time
to deliver the one hundred invitations
I’d scribbled while on the phone with the mortuary:Because of the short notice no need to rsvp.
Unfortunately the firemen couldn’t come.
(I had hoped they’d give free rides on the truck.)
They did agree to drive by the house once
with the lights on— It was a party after all.
I put Mom and Dad in charge of balloons,
let them blow as many years of my brother’s name,
jails, twenty-dollar bills, midnight phone calls,
fistfights, and er visits as they could let go of.
The scarlet balloons zigzagged along the ceiling
like they’d been filled with helium. Mom blew up
so many that she fell asleep. She slept for ten years—
she missed the whole party.
My brothers and sisters were giddy, shredding
his stained T-shirts and raggedy pants, throwing them up
into the air like confetti.
When the clowns came in a few balloons slipped out
the front door. They seemed to know where
they were going and shrank to a fistful of red grins
at the end of our cul-de-sac. The clowns played toy bugles
until the air was scented with rotten raspberries.
They pulled scarves from Mom’s ear—she slept through it.
I baked my brother’s favorite cake (chocolate, white frosting).
When I counted there were ninety-nine of us in the kitchen.
We all stuck our fingers in the mixing bowl.
A few stray dogs came to the window.
I heard their stomachs and mouths growling
over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom.
(There was no room in the hallway because of the magician.)
The mariachis complained about the bathtub acoustics.
I told the dogs, No more cake here, and shut the window.
The fire truck came by with the sirens on. The dogs ran away.
I sliced the cake into ninety-nine pieces.
I wrapped all the electronic equipment in the house,
taped pink bows and glittery ribbons to them—
remote controls, the Polaroid, stereo, Shop-Vac,
even the motor to Dad’s work truck—everything
my brother had taken apart and put back together
doing his crystal meth tricks—he’d always been
a magician of sorts.
Two mutants came to the door.
One looked almost human. They wanted
to know if my brother had willed them the pots
and pans and spoons stacked in his basement bedroom.
They said they missed my brother’s cooking and did we
have any cake. No more cake here, I told them.Well, what’s in the piñata? they asked. I told them
God was and they ran into the desert, barefoot.
I gave Dad his slice and put Mom’s in the freezer.
I brought up the pots and pans and spoons
(really, my brother was a horrible cook), banged them
together like a New Year’s Day celebration.
My brother finally showed up asking why
he hadn’t been invited and who baked the cake.
He told me I shouldn’t smile, that this whole party was shit
because I’d imagined it all. The worst part he said was
he was still alive. The worst part he said was
he wasn’t even dead. I think he’s right, but maybe
the worst part is that I’m still imagining the party, maybe
the worst part is that I can still taste the cake.

But moving up the trail, we caught a glimpse

the grass-inscribed sand. Neither of us looked—
it seemed best to back away.
On the dune’s steep side
we surveyed what we’d come for: ocean’s
snaking blues beyond the meadow, the silvered
blade-like wands lying down. Lovely enough
to hold ourselves to that view.

The young man, hardly more
than a boy, who fired the shot
had looked at him with an air
not of anger but of concentration,
as if he were surveying a road,
or feeding a length of wood into a saw:
It had to be done just so.
The bullet passed through
his upper chest, below the collar bone.

have feared. Strangely exhilarated
he staggered out of the pasture

He pressed and pressed

the blood, but he could only press
what he could reach, and he could
not reach his back, where the bullet
had exited.

His fingers and feet tingled,

of Christ, who said, I thirst.
His man-smell, the smell of his hair

of his cock and the little ferny hairs
that two women had known
left him, and a sharp, almost sweet
smell began to rise from his open mouth

And over the stairway, at the foot—oh! here, leave desolate, passionate hands to spread Violets, roses, and laurel with the small sweet twinkling country things Speaking so wistfully of other Springs From the little gardens of little places where son or sweetheart was born and bred. In splendid sleep, with a thousand brothers      To lovers—to mothers      Here, too, lies he: Under the purple, the green, the red, It is all young life: it must break some women's hearts to see Such a brave, gay coverlet to such a bed! Only, when all is done and said, God is not mocked and neither are the dead.  For this will stand in our Market-place—      Who'll sell, who'll buy      (Will you or I Lie each to each with the better grace)? While looking into every busy whore's and huckster's face As they drive their bargains, is the Face Of God: and some young, piteous, murdered face.

I feel the spring far off, far off,    The faint, far scent of bud and leaf— Oh, how can spring take heart to come    To a world in grief,    Deep grief?

The grass is waking in the ground,    Soon it will rise and blow in waves— How can it have the heart to sway    Over the graves,    New graves?

There is something in the sound of drum and fife That stirs all the savage instincts into life.   In the old times of peace we went our ways, Through proper days Of little joys and tasks. Lonely at times, When from the steeple sounded wedding chimes, Telling to all the world some maid was wife— But taking patiently our part in life As it was portioned us by Church and State, Believing it our fate.     Our thoughts all chaste Held yet a secret wish to love and mate     Ere youth and virtue should go quite to waste. But men we criticised for lack of strength, And kept them at arm's length. Then the war came— The world was all aflame! The men we had thought dull and void of power Were heroes in an hour. He who had seemed a slave to petty greed Showed masterful in that great time of need. He who had plotted for his neighbour's pelf, Now for his fellows offers up himself. And we were only women, forced by war To sacrifice the things worth living for.  Something within us broke,    Something within us woke,        The wild cave-woman spoke.  When we heard the sound of drumming,    As our soldiers went to camp,    Heard them tramp, tramp, tramp; As we watched to see them coming,    And they looked at us and smiled    (Yes, looked back at us and smiled), As they filed along by hillock and by hollow,    Then our hearts were so beguiled    That, for many and many a day,    We dreamed we heard them say, 'Oh, follow, follow, follow!'    And the distant, rolling drum    Called us 'Come, come, come!'    Till our virtue seemed a thing to give away.   War had swept ten thousand years away from earth.    We were primal once again.    There were males, not modern men; We were females meant to bring their sons to birth.    And we could not wait for any formal rite,    We could hear them calling to us, 'Come to-night; For to-morrow, at the dawn, We move on!'    And the drum    Bellowed, 'Come, come, come!' And the fife Whistled, 'Life, life, life!'   So they moved on and fought and bled and died; Honoured and mourned, they are the nation's pride. We fought our battles, too, but with the tide Of our red blood, we gave the world new lives. Because we were not wives We are dishonoured. Is it noble, then, To break God's laws only by killing men To save one's country from destruction? We took no man's life but gave our chastity, And sinned the ancient sin To plant young trees and fill felled forests in.   Oh, clergy of the land, Bible in hand, All reverently you stand,    On holy thoughts intent    While barren wives receive the sacrament! Had you the open visions you could see    Phantoms of infants murdered in the womb,    Who never knew a cradle or a tomb, Hovering about these wives accusingly.   Bestow the sacrament! Their sins are not well known— Ours to the four winds of the earth are blown.

I.
The nest was at rest for a time, not being
made. Before the eggs were laid, it softened.
The robin sleeping. Inside the house,
the sound of laundry
in the dryer, the sound of a zipper
tumbling inside
the apparatus, and shirts with buttons,
as well as napkins
and a tablecloth printed with blueberries
and stalks of lily of the valley, oval,
for the table with claw legs
and extra leaves for guests.
II.
In one account, the angels come, their hands
emerging from their wings like sentences
staying, as long as it takes,
for the windows to go from indigo
to black, as long
as it takes for a breath to land in the base
of the belly, in the cavity
wisdom tells us wisdom comes from
or first dwells in, before it navigates
the narrows of the throat, becomes mantra,
becomes guttural, becomes spit to aspirate
the language the mouth makes.
The native obligation of this account
to its subject is care. The form
of music the wind chime makes
registers the commitment
of a furious system, filled with
conviction, to the continued
transformation of what
is. Do not ask what has been
lost. Ask what changed. An instrument
of will, the guitar echoes this, a chord,
more reminder than absolute, the hand
arouses but does not create the scale.
In this way what rests gets taken up.
III. 
In another, the mind makes a decision
to end its disorder. The mind wants first
to end the face. The subject
has had enough, one too many
figures walking through the orchard, the call
and response of conversation
become an imposition on some other world
unbroken by the idea of separate bodies,
an idea one has never been convinced of,
and so now it is a relief to believe
what one has suspected, that separation
a trick of perspective, though such a revelation
does not undo the fatigue of existing
in the continuing illusions of others. And yet, the obligation
to be kind, to show interest in strangers
when they visit with flowers, to family
whose hands are empty, and to doctors,
not to mention the pain.
IV. 
In the last account, the explosions
are too small to be seen, and oxygen
takes both thirst and hunger away
as it ceases to find a home in the lungs,
and the patient, having ceased to feel, ceases
to breathe, as the heart shuts down
before the brain and shuts
the dreaming down, the settling on a nest
of images, not feeling any form of distress.
The pathways to distress are blocked,
but the senses doubled, the ears know
the house more than they ever did,
whose clothes occupy the dryer,
which voice accompanies water.

pane frames what we call a family,

finishes what she is thinking about,
barely but still hidden from sight.

the ladder of adoration would reverse
and you would stay on earth.

she borrowed from rabbinical school—and begins to read in Aramaic.

from the Glickstein's double plot. We eat yellow sponge cake and drink
small cups of brandy to celebrate my grandmother's life. We are no longer mourners,

My son cracks a plastic cup until it's shredded to strips, looks like a clear spider,

my grandmother was barely fit on the face of the marker. A year ago at the funeral,
her friend Goldie told me she was strong like steel, soft like butter—women like thatthey don't make any more. My mother tries to show my grandmother—now this gray marker—

Her strength was beyond description. The people who sang to their children in Yiddish

The body was one thing we always had
in common, even when between us
a continent unfolded. Eric says,We scattered his ashes beneath the Japanese maplehere behind the house. No ceremony,
as you wished, but this...
What you wanted from me was complex
and simple, both. Once you asked for more
than I had to give. I live
with this; call it regret. Your hands bloom
in the intaglioed scrawl, creased onion skin tattooed
with garnet stamps from Pietrasanta,
a sifting of marble dust...Images: chiseled
jut of jaw, cheek, bridge of nose—recall
each granite face rising from New Hampshire
dirt upon which faltering, you last stepped.
In 1729, long before either of us came
to be, Reiner Ottens dragged his fine tip
across a smooth sheet: Globi Coelestisin Tabulas Planas Redacti Pars III. Bright beings—
lobster, serpent, bison, dove bearing the requisite
sprig—swirl and writhe over lines that pin
distance and story to time.
Spectral creatures that we are, connecting dots
to chart our ways....If only I could wrap
the whole plane back into its ball.

Death is careless at times. It confuses love with a wet afternoon in an empty
room.  The  unpainted walls a reminder of how sex can resemble poverty.  A
hollow  cry.   An open mouth falling inside as you sleep.   I prepare  my heart
and language with better words,  like worlds in small selves  I've built.  Every
month,  one dollar buys me one brick.  But  how many bricks  does  it  take to
build a house?  A stray dog barks late at night.  I can't  see him  but know he's
there.   He   reminds   me   that  here,  dreams  have  dangerous  turns.  I  turn
around  to  no  one  naked  beside  me. I  play  it  safe  not to see the fire in my
hands.  But let us be clear:  I'm no beggar.  It's  just that there are times  when 
the  world  is  a  sound  that  cripples  the air,  and the soul. When what seems
arranged — glazing and  strange,  like  music  played on tin cans — turns  into
wilting  noise.  When  suddenly,  all  that  exists  is  a small boy trying to focus
on the pain lifting a nation.  A telephone call:  He was wearing black shoes, a 
Calvin  Klein  T-shirt  that he  found in a hotel trash, brown slacks.  She  was
wearing  one  earring  on her right ear,  one sock on her left foot, a dress the
color  of sky.  She  bought him  a canne à sucre.  He pulled her close, said, Ti
cherie.   And  after  they  promised  to meet  later,   she  winked  and  walked
leisurely in the shade. A tremble followed. When he turned around, her body
was one of a thousand on the streets. He ran towards her, stood by her arm,unable to see her face. The call drops. I begin to count the ways I tolerate my
dry mouth. To count the glasses of water I gave away to make up for my sins.
But this act does not count when we fall out of our hearts.

Inside the night, this hospital, asylum,
this party for those undone by desire, forever
unslaked, inside a house inside the night,
I'm inside
this house with eight beams and moonlight
pulling on the past through skylights, this house
of white noise, wind and dry heat, lonely
house on a ridge line, house of ordinary
shame,
my sister's house with corrals and outbuildings
around it, and beyond that, the dog
patrolling, and beyond that, skirts and folds
of the mountain rising in rumpled geologic
scrolls into the range.
At the center
beneath the moon's silence that nothing
ever changes, muffled in blankets with fear
beside me on my little bench of sleep,
I can hear their voices,
could be three or twenty-three,
unhinged saints gabbling to their shadows,
or panty-sniffers, drug-trippers in all flavors
past vanilla, could be Birnam wood
on the move, the shriek of its roots thirsty
and air-brushed, or a pack of lunatics
crooning norteño songs.
What is certain is advent.
They're coming down,
                             coming towards
the heart beneath the feathers,
coming for
what can't be protected,
on a beam of dread,
riding that ray.
I'm listening, my eyes snapped-open
inside darkness, other people in other rooms
who know how to sleep through a night
like this night, thrown against the roundness
of the world which is desire.
The old bitch guards this night on the ranch,
half shepherd, half other, this is her watch,
she gallops the perimeter, anxious to sound like
more than one dog, though she's going arthritic
and her paws strike the hard ground.
Now they quiet, penitents, lunatics,
marauders and ragpickers, quiet.
Only one left behind and the moon
                           is his hieroglyph,
one creature padding
                down the mountain,
coming closer.
Coyote knows a good joke,
he only wants to let her in on it.
He can't stop laughing, can't stop
crying, can't stop licking the crevices
clean, licking safety and duty
until they're empty.
I hear the dog listening, ears lifted.
Coyote's tongue slides into night
air, pressing narcotic vowels throughwonder, through longing
and longing and wonder awaken. She's close
to that edge, that border in the night
where one thing becomes another and even
an old dog who's worked a ranch eleven years
feels the urge to let loose, blow this little
settlement, go wild.
Clouds loose and blue in the arms
of the moon, slant light on this mountain raking
us, the dog and I, we feel the pull. Imagine
a woman trying to come between
coyote and the female he's after
when she knows
what is dark and offers itself and vanishes
has come for her at last? The body wants
what it can't have, to follow the path
of thirst through the rent in the wire
beyond the corral.
The dog doesn't move, but who knows
better than she the small outpost
death has set up in her, maybe she's all
desire now to slip under the moon
and chase down that lure.
Coyote wheedles and croons another minute
or two, then lopes off, calling over his shoulder
in a language even I can understand,
the right names for thingsnot kept in heaven.

A new obsession. How to get out
of cold, metallic waters alive.
Every night for a week I dream
of my car ending up in a body
of water. If I’m not driving, someone
else is. Bob, the neighbor.
My new paranoia.
I Google how to escape a car
filling with water. I watch videos
on YouTube. I memorize the steps
of what to do if this happens. First,
you take your seat belt off. Late at night,
I read pages and pages on the internet.
What if the car lands
in the water flipped over?
Remember to stay calm.
If you panic, you will die.
News story about a woman who drives
her minivan into the ocean on purpose.
Horrified beachgoers run toward the water.
The two kids are strapped in the back seat.
One of the kids is screaming “No, mommy” —
What about the sunroof?
What if you land in the water
and your car has a sunroof?
My new car has a sunroof.
You have to let the car fill with water
so that pressure is equalized on both sides.
This is elementary physics.
If you don’t do this, it’s
impossible to open the doors.
This is the scary part.
You have to hold your breath.
None of the YouTube videos say anything
about what to do if you have
kids strapped in car seats in the car.
I look up what the dreams mean.
Water in dreams signifies turbulent emotions.
If you are in your car and there
is a flash flood, you should get out immediately.
Even six inches of water can sweep your car away.
Sweep it to where?
Maybe the forest?
I get nervous driving by the Gulf of Mexico.
My friend Dyan got into an accident
there and she said that if the car had
flipped on the other side of the road,
her whole family would
have ended up in the water.
I don’t like water.
I don’t want to touch it.
It scares me.
I know all life was born of water.
Today the government proposed
to sell off all public lands.
That before anything existed
there were rocks and then water.
I know that water is beautiful and mysterious.
But why does it sweep people away?
I want to push down the rising seas.
I look at a map of cities that will be underwater by 2100, 2200 — 
Jacksonville, New Orleans, Amsterdam.
I want to push them down with my bare hands.

We are soft-caged behind streaked windows, our someday plans
grayed and siphoned flat. “Faith” is simply a church sound, not strong
like “factory,” “scrubbing the chitlins,” or “keeping that man.”
But could faith be a blatant gold blasting through dinner’s fatty fumes,
its perfumed lure tangling with the smell of twice-fried potatoes
and twist-tied bags of reeking rubbish lining the dark hall?
Fluttering beneath florescent sputter, could faith warm our rooms,
even the walls scrubbed raw with Baptist chill? If we let faith in,

anticipate its slow glories, beg it to begin?

Murders will not let you forget.
You remember the children you had — suddenly quarry, target —
the daughters with gunfire smoldering circles in their napped hair,
the absent sons whose screams still ride the air.
You knew the ways of bullets, prayed your child run, outrun, beat
them in their race toward the heart of your baby, your sweet.
You imagine another child cocking the hammer with his thumb,
or blazing the blade forward, harkening the dark that will overcome
you. Never again will you look at a bright, upturned face and sigh,
returning again and again to drown your baby in the mama-eye.
I hear on Kilbourn, on Christiana, the not-there of my children.
I have pushed them flail and wriggle from my tired body, eased
my babies into a world of growl and gun. The breath-suck,
I wailed and prayed, my loves, as rougher mothers seized
you. Now I am newly barren, drained of mother luck,
and you are suddenly far beyond my futile reach.
If I let these frantic streets deny the tender in your names,
if I relinquished you to this city and its unrelenting games,
your end is all I own. If I dared let others govern your deaths,
if I wasn’t there to mourn your final blurring breaths,
believe that my loss of you to this was not deliberate.
Though I have no right to whine,
whine that none of the blame was mine,
since, in every world I’m rooted in, you are dead.
Or rather, or instead,
you are so much a hollow of the children I made.
But now you are scar on the pavement. I am afraid —
is that the you there is now, how the story of you will be said?
You were born — a gunshot, a swift blade — then you died.
It’s too much this way — even the child who killed you cried.
Believe. I loved you all.
Be. Leave me the sounds of still-thudding hearts. I grieve you

how they’re tucked in their beds by a quarter to nine.
My mama, with her country ways, try as she may,
will never turn me into a weeds and wildflowers woman,
that’s a fact. I only stay up late
on account of all her party folk flooding our back gate.
But that’s OK. I think front yard folk are perfect. Really, I do.
And I’m gonna be a righteous woman, too.
And wear a soft cardigan, cashmere trimmed in lace.
And stroll ’round all of Lawndale with this righteous on my face.

To be a bride of my own lamentation
I wear a dress not of time’s poisoned quills
but feathers of discontent — kingfishers
ghosting in cornstalks, my field of frozen flutes.
The edge of descent, digression’s highway
brings a particulate ash to my mouth,
starry metals of the meadow’s cold snap,
ravens in the sycamore scorched to black.
I follow their echo’s loop and chase.
I master the map of never, raft
its fragments, mouth the brightness of human’s
leftover snow, details of fever-clouds
where the convent dissolves in violence.
I wear the canyon like a blank eye,
lay before the never-returning light
my silhouette, fossil of the drowned town’s scroll.•
Here, where your ghost is always departing
the ebb and flow of terrestrial tides,
I follow your echo’s loop and chase,
vortex streets of a cylindrical sound
infinite in its arrangements of light.
The evening veil, a partial reveal — 
how I appear to myself looking past
this fact of being underway. Each day
I stow my earthen materials
in preparation for the never-end.
In the snapshot of my dead friend, hanging
in the room where loved ones refuse return:
a gradual reduction of color.
Running out of time, neck-deep in water,
we knew no one was coming to help us
in the same way one denies language
to come from a picture. I imagine
love a revelation, not of mind — 
the blue gauze of planetary motion — 
a tone-on-tone painting of a body
floating on the sea’s shifting horizons.
It is a question of legibility.
When I became tired of depicting
poetry, I became aware of
another kind of plane, the kind
good for dwellings and their narrative escape.
Here children sit up all night by the flames — 
the orphan boy from blood-stained pottery
who singed his head and burned out both his eyes.
That was your life, a prefix for fire.
Spider will weave a ladder to your heart,
it is said, even though you are sleeping,
intoxicated by abandonment,
a bitter wind reminiscent of a wave.•
In the last days of my marriage to god,
I wandered his spiraled library
to read in the dark blank imprints of trees.
Relentless navigation through the stacks
of shell-tempered mortuary offerings,
sandstone saws recovered from the caves.
I lingered on the stairs of the convent
to write these things, to recollect myself.
Around midnight the mountains returned.
The clouds dispersed into semicolons
and I with them, into a new language,
its boat temporary, invisible.
I knew I would be traveling like this
for centuries. This was my first attempt
at vanishing. I would return before
anyone noticed poems to be found
in the forest, not the mind.
There’s a canyon between this version of me
and the shadow in the corner that is mine.
I wear this canyon like a blank eye.

Caretakers — died in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, one after another. One didn’t show up because her husband was in prison. Most others watched the clock. Time breaks for the living eventually and they can walk out of doors. The handle of time’s door is hot for the dying. What use is a door if you can’t exit? A door that can’t be opened is called a wall. My father is on the other side of the wall. Tomatoes are ripening on the other side. I can see them through the window that also can’t be opened. A window that can’t be opened is just a see-through wall. Sometimes we’re on the inside like a plane. Most of the time, we’re on the outside like doggie day care. I don’t know if the tomatoes are the new form of his language or if they’re simply for eating. I can’t ask him  because on the other side, there are no words. All I can do is stare at the nameless bursting tomatoes and know they have to be enough.

How hard it is to sleep
in the middle of a life.
— Audre Lorde



We wake in the middle of a life,                    hungry.
We smear durian            along our mouths, sing soft
death a lullaby. Carcass breath, eros of  licked fingers
and the finest perfume. What is love if  not         rot?
We wear the fruit’s hull as a spiked crown, grinning
in green armor.   Death to the grub, fat in his milky
shuffle! Death to the lawlessness       of dirt! Death
to mud and its false chocolate!   To the bloated sun
we want to slice open and yolk                      all over
the village. We want a sun-drenched           slug feast,
an omelet loosening its folds like hot Jell-O. We want
the marbled fat of steak and all        its swirling pink
galaxies. We want the drool, the gnash, the pluck of
each corn kernel, raw and summer                   swell.
Tears welling up                     oil. Order up! Pickled
cucumbers piled like logs for a fire, like fat limbs we
pepper and succulent                in. Order up: shrimp
chips curling in a porcelain bowl like subway seats.
Grapes peeled from bitter bark — almost translucent,
like eyes we would rather see. Little girl, what do you
leave, leaven              in your sight? Death to the open
eyes of  the dying. Here,           there are so many open
eyes we can’t close each one.          No, we did not say
the steamed eye of a fish. No eyelids fluttering like
no butterfly wings. No purple yam lips. We said eyes.
Still and resolute as a heartbreaker.         Does this break
your heart?                                      Look, we don’t want
to be rude, but seconds, please. Want: globes of oranges
swallowed whole like a basketball or Mars or whatever
planet is the most delicious.                   Slather Saturn!
Ferment Mercury! Lap up its film of dust, yuk sung!
Seconds, thirds, fourths! Meat wool! A bouquet of
chicken feet! A garden of                   melons, monstrous
in their bulge!               Prune back nothing. We purr
in this garden. We comb through berries and come out
so blue. Little girl,                            lasso tofu, the rope
slicing its belly clean. Deep fry a cloud so it tastes like
bitter gourd or your father leaving — the exhaust of
his car, charred. Serenade a snake and slither its tongue
into yours and                           bite. Love! What is love
if  not knotted in garlic? Child, we move through graves
like eels, delicious         with our heads first, our mouths
agape. Our teeth:         little needles to stitch a factory of
everything made in China.      You ask: Are you hungry?
Hunger eats through the air like ozone. You ask: What
does it mean to be rootless? Roots are good to use as
toothpicks. You: How can you wake in the middle of
a life? We shut and open our eyes like the sun shining
on tossed pennies in a forgotten well. Bald copper,
blood. Yu choy bolts                  into roses down here.
While you were sleeping, we woke to the old leaves
of  your backyard shed and ate that and one of your
lost flip-flops too. In a future life, we saw rats overtake
a supermarket with so much milk, we turned opaque.
We wake to something boiling. We wake to wash dirt
from lettuce, to blossom into your face. Aphids along
the lashes. Little girl, don’t forget              to take care
of  the chickens, squawking in their mess and stench.
Did our mouths buckle                                at the sight
of  you devouring slice                after slice of  pizza and
the greasy box too? Does this frontier swoon for you?
It’s time to wake up. Wake the tapeworm who loves
his home. Wake the ants,                  let them do-si-do
a spoonful of  peanut butter. Tell us, little girl, are you
hungry, awake,                               astonished enough?

(of course it’s still alive     I know because I know)    
so     after the seal first began to loosen, things accelerated after that     and I could see inside of  it     and what I saw was a tongue     but very pale     the tongue was white, in fact, and thin as a strip of paper     also smooth     no bumps or grooves     but there was no doubt: this was a tongue
I’m sorry    I used the past tense only so that you might understand how it appeared to me when it was new and strange     to describe to you what I saw then     not because it’s changed     because it hasn’t      except in its familiarity
I spend an hour with it every morning      and if the weather’s mild, after they’ve gone to bed, I take it out at night, lie on my back in the grass, hold the jar on my chest, and together we watch the metallic flower petals spin at each other in that dangerous memory of  heaven, or the past    please     don’t cry    no one’s to blame     and nothing’s ruined, nothing’s wrong      there’s no discomfort      there seems to be no pain     there’s only time, letting something looser     and I’ve made the preparations     it will die when I die
no, she isn’t listening    and if  she is     well, then the eavesdropper’s punishment is hers      she can’t be spared      all her life spent holding her breath    only to hear     the sound absorbed by moss stuffed into the ears of  a stillborn kitten      all her life     over and over again at the kitchen table     playing the tapes of a conversation she recorded with a microphone slipped into a coffin thirty-six years ago     finding no meaning in those     and searching for the jar in which she’s certain it still floats      the tongue of  her mother’s ghost

                    The Rule of Three
                ","
One of the first I learned was the trinity, three persons in one
God: father, son, and holy spirit, née ghost. Then I started writing
JMJ on all my homework and tests, for good luck, but also because
My ballpoint’s blue ink looked pretty beside the paper’s purple
Ink, like the inside of a clamshell when I teared up or squinted
From the smell. Sometimes the sheets were wet and curled like
Petals reeking of gin, which is why it was called spirit duplication,
After the nonflammable alcohol used in the process. Jesus, Mary,
And Joseph, is what the three initials meant. I’d draw a cross from
The descending caret of the M and think of Mary, the mother,
And of the other Mary, not, weeping at the limp feet of the crucified
Jesus. Where was Joseph, I wondered, but never asked. We seemed
To pity him a little, for reasons I couldn’t name, like my father,
Who was both my father and a son, and soon to be the son of
His father’s ghost. When my grandmother was dying, she asked
Her only child, my mother, to go with her. Mom waited decades
To obey, but she finally went. Together in one grave now, they are
Two Marys, maybe with the Jesus of their most solitary prayers,
Petals littering their one stone’s four corners. Being motherless,
Like being childless, is both good and bad, I think,
And it is a third thing, too, that is neither of these.

In one segment of the landscape, a hyena drags her clitoris
across the plains, a dust perfuming up. Cicadas pulse the segment,
a femur filled with rain. It is a lush grassland within which
the greens have sprouted through the exposed joints of animals.
This seems to be a metaphor for growth and resistance. A
single singed dollar rolls through the wind. I read
a book that imagines, among other things, a world without
trees. I wrote a book that imagines, among other things, a world
without men. The book splayed open on my parents’ dresser,
an early part of the book. People do this when they no longer
want to see information. I no longer want to see information.
In another segment, a series of weasel oil candles, such is
the cure-all in this aspect of land. Mostly the candles are not
lit. At night the moon makes the earth shine like bottle
flies, a glimmer here and there where a lachrymose flame
continues on. A god peeks past the clit of the hyena
disapprovingly, as evidenced by their glare and nod. But I
want a god to glare and nod. I want a god to do anything at all
with my debts. In another segment, my grandmother
lives and she watches a pack of lionesses feasting inside
the rib cage of a zebra. At first, she tells us, she believes
the zebra to be sleeping on her side, but the lions move
her skin under the membrane of bones.
It’s like I always say: The evenings wait for the kind of
death we get and we are so very fond of the evenings.

because a single woman is braiding her hair in a desert.

He looked down at his withering body and saw a hair near his navel, swaying.   And now he saw his other hairs rise up.   He felt a hectic current in his veins. Looking within, he saw the bubbling of his blood.   He cursed his fever, saying: “It is the chemistry of prayer. It increases in frequency, seeding panic to all my being. My cells swell with the liquid of guilt they fabricate, juices of hatred eat my belly my corpuscles make war in me as they devour each other. My head heats in the combustion of anxiety, I am polluted by the secretions of my soul’s decay, while my brain wears away with the scratching night and day on the encephalograph of prayer. I grow monstrous with the leukemia of the world.”   And he heard the hair say: “Hear me.” And he saw it grow gray as it waved. All his hairs he saw whiten, and, numberless, wilt from their erect electric listening. He saw them topple from their roots. “How dare you!” he cursed them. There surged a brief resuscitation to his body. His heart took heart and pounded twice with the health of fear But then the plague of prayer redoubled and overwhelmed him.   In his feebleness he raged, and said: “I will tear out this evil and free it.”With his withered hands he tore the remaining hairs from his body and head. With his nails he opened his breast, and with his fist he exploded his heart, which erupted, a black and red volcano.   As his brain tasted, for the first time, the birth of his doom, he came a rolling tide, a floating mountain of ecstasy. “I see you! I love you!” his eyes cried, overflowing with his bright blood. “You were the light of the world that are now my gushing tears— the kind and fiery tears of chaos, that wash my eyes with the cure of oblivion.”   “He hears us!” cried his sick blood pouring from his ears. “Even as of old he heard our hair before it perished.”   With his last strength, the chemistry of prayer, a few drops of his blood coagulated. That clot whirled out, free, in the vortex of the universe.

By boat to Seurasaari where the small fish were called vendace.  A man blew a horn of birchwood toward the nightless sea.Still voice. Fire that is no fire. Ahead years unknown to be lived—Bells from the tower in the all-at-once, then one by one, hours. Outside (so fleetingly) ourselves—In a still mirror, in a blue within where this earthly journey dreamingitself begins,thought into being from the hidden to the end of the visible.Mountains before and behind, heather and lichen, yarrow, gorse,then a sea village of chartreuse fronds.Spent fuel, burntwind, mute swans. We drove the birch-lined highway from Dresden to Berlin behind armored cars in late afternoon, nineteenth of June, passing the black cloud of a freight truck from Budapest.Through disappearingvillages, past horses grazing vanished fields.The year before you died, America went to war again on the other side of the world.This is how the earth becomes, you said, a grotto of skeletons. In the ruins of a station: a soaked bed, broken chairs, a dead coal stove.White weather, chalk and basalt, puffins, fuchsia and history shot through with particles of recognition: this one wetted down with petrol then set alight, that one taking forty rounds, this other found eleven years later in a bog.In the station house, imaginary maps, smoke chased by wind, a registry of arrivals, the logs of ghost ships and a few prison diaries written on tissue paper.Do you remember the blue-leaved lilies?   The grotto, the hoarfrost, the frieze?  Through the casements of glass hand-blown before the war, a birch tree lets snow drop through its limbs onto other birches. Birch twigsin wind through glass.Who were we then? Such a laughter as morning peeled its light from us!   You said the cemeteries were full in a voice like wind plaiting willows—fields in bloom but silent without grasshoppers or bees.  What do you want then? You with your neverness, your unknown, your book of things, youwith once years ahead to be lived.Your father believes he took you with him, that you arein an urn beside your sleeping motherbut I am still writing with your hand,as you stand in your still-there of lighted words.Such is the piano’s sadness and the rifle’s moonlight.  Stairwells remember as do doors, but windows do not—do not, upon waking, gaze out a window if you wish to remember your dreamAn ache of hope that you will come back—the cawing flock is not your coming.Did you float toward Salzburg? A windin the mustard fields?—or walk instead beside me through the asylum in Krakow?   Hours after your death you seemed everywhere at once like the swifts at twilight.  Now your moments are cloudsin a photograph of swifts. In the hour held open between day and night under the meteor showers of Perseidwe held each other for the last time.Dead, you whispered where is the road?

To be assembled again in the work rooms of clouds.She rose from where they found her lyingnot far from a water urn, leaving herself behind on the groundwhere they found her, holding her armsbefore her as if she were asleep.That is how she appears to me: a ghost in heaven.Carrying her arms in her arms.Blue smoke from corn cribs, flap of wings.On the walls of the city streets a plague of initials.Walking through a fire-lit river to a burning house: dead Singersewing machine and piece of dress. Outside a cashew tree wept blackened cashews over lamina. Outside paper fireflies rose to the stars.Bring penicillin if you can, surgical tape, a whetstone, mosquito repellent but not the aerosol kind. Especially bring a syringe for sucking phlegm,a knife, wooden sticks, a surgical clamp, and plastic bags.You will need a bottle of cloud for anesthesia.Like the flight of a crane through colorless dreams.When a leech opens your flesh it leaves a small volcano.Always pour turpentine over your hair before going to sleep.Such experiences as these are forgotten before memory intrudes.The girl was found (don’t say this)with a man’s severed head stuffed into her where a child would have been.No one knew who the man was. Another of the dead. So they had not, after all, killed a pregnant girl. This was a relief to them.That sound in the brush? A settling of wind in sorghum.If they capture you, talk.Talk. Please yes. You heard me right the first time.You will be asked who you are.Eventually, we are all asked who we are.All who come All who come into the worldAll who come into the world are sent.Open your curtain of spirit.

Flickering evening on the lakes recalls those young heirs whose developing years have sunk to earth, their strength not tested, their praise unsung.

This year, the winter sky in Missouri is a kind of coldThe color of a turtle’s hood, a soup of dandelion, burdock root, and clay.

A husband puts an afghan over the dead goat’s
torso, combs the knots out of  her beard.
The goat smells chalk, wonders when the riders
will come in their wool pakols red from walnuts, spurs
chirring like castanets. The buzkashi whips
will grow damp in their mouths, their rope belts
slowly twisting in place. She knows
not to be devoured is a perfect sentiment
because she has thoughts to gather, faces to grow,
hunger this morning and no throat, only
the song in her teeth that goes on
indefinitely as he saws off each hoof, just
above the ankle, her knees bent for praying.
Her head is axed. Her collar
falls to the ground, its circle unbroken. She looks to see
how deep is the pool of  blood is a river
of  no one becoming her. With salt in her heart
she’ll stay good for days. He’s been to her like her father
he killed. He’s been to her like the father he killed.
He turns her face to the window: mountains
oddly still in the milk broth of oblivion. Intercourse:
the sun drove a man in the ground like a stake.

What I adore is not horses, with their moderndomestic life span of 25 years.

You’re stepping on your father, my mother said,and indeed I was standing exactly in the centerof a bed of grass, mown so neatly it could have beenmy father’s grave, although there was no stone saying so.You’re stepping on your father, she repeated,louder this time, which began to be strange to me,since she was dead herself; even the doctor had admitted it.I moved slightly to the side, to wheremy father ended and my mother began.The cemetery was silent. Wind blew through the trees;I could hear, very faintly, sounds of  weeping several rows away,and beyond that, a dog wailing. At length these sounds abated. It crossed my mindI had no memory of   being driven here,to what now seemed a cemetery, though it could have beena cemetery in my mind only; perhaps it was a park, or if not a park,a garden or bower, perfumed, I now realized, with the scent of roses — douceur de vivre filling the air, the sweetness of  living,as the saying goes. At some point,it occurred to me I was alone.Where had the others gone,my cousins and sister, Caitlin and Abigail?By now the light was fading. Where was the carwaiting to take us home?I then began seeking for some alternative. I feltan impatience growing in me, approaching, I would say, anxiety.Finally, in the distance, I made out a small train,stopped, it seemed, behind some foliage, the conductorlingering against a doorframe, smoking a cigarette.Do not forget me, I cried, running nowover many plots, many mothers and fathers —",Louise Glück,"Living,Death,Sorrow & Grieving,Activities,Travels & Journeys,Relationships,Family & Ancestors",F

To keep anxiety at bay, my friend called chemo dragonfly love. Those insects — christened, in places, the devil’s darning needles — hover as they contort their joined bodies into a heart, the male with pincers. Finger cutter, horse killer, ear stick, eye pisser. Look closely at the eyes of a female darner and you may well see dark puncture marks. As a slow drip through an IV. As a pill. Through a port into a vein. She called nausea erotica. Just the same, we name our storms to lessen them —  not a tropical cyclone, but Arabella, with ballet shoes and bun. Tumors, too, were friends, waiting at the bus stop with backpacks in the morning. Cindy French braids Carrie’s hair, yanking at the scalp to form the tight crisscross. Not hair loss, but deep conditioning. She gave us the new lexicon on stationery embossed with a red rose speckled by raindrops. The stem still had its thorns. Ring-around-the-rosy, red rover, red rover, send her right over. She called death the world of 10,000 things: the dragon courting its damsel, catheter tubing in the wastebin, video of a toddler biting his brother, pas de deux, full- sugar ice cream, Crimson Queen, Trumpeter, Red Knockout, Tuscany Superb  ...    I knew her as Rose Shapiro.

Pour wax into the gate of an ox’s heart.

Amidst the glossy dark green foliageof trees around the hotel pool,I spy a low-hanging golden fruit.So many trees whose names I do not knowand for the first time do not care to learn.The overwhelming now in its countless inflectionscancels vocabulary: eyes lips skininstead of words. Still in the pool,floating on my back as the sun gets low,I look at the mango, if that is what it is(I think it is some wholly other fruit),and suddenly smell garlic sautéed in butter.Chefs in the kitchen under the treesare getting the hors d’oeuvres ready.Yesterday in a dim, airless gallery,following your lead,I hunted down an iconographywritten in a grisly alphabetyet full of life, the haunting gaze direct,transcending death. Death had in winning lost.Art trumped death and life trumped art. Last night(our third together — sleepa whole new texture in a bed with you)I gave you space and found myself at the borderof a far province in the king-sized bed,a dimly lit hinterland where paintings ruled,a region wholly devoted to the workof the same painter, mysteriously killed,stoned to death (“lapidated” was one word),assassinated — why? A mysteryto be solved by iconography?Death had won but also death had lost.Garlic and butter. Glossy dark green leaves.Voices across the pool. A hanging fruit.An azure splash. And as the sun goes down,you sit by the window in our room,drawing pictures of this this this time.What to call it? Colors in your handstrump words. Like the fruit,like the solution to the mystery,something I am at a loss to name.

walking to the hospital How the autumn dawn burned throughthe misty broods and settled down in fire;how quickly the sun glittered my shadow,how my shadow cried, a moment, with joy.A light frost, a vision of light cracklingdown the maples, down the tinder ash.I was the good thief. I held my Love’ssweet breath, his beautiful, intelligent gaze.I closed my eyes and he woke inside me.When I saw, he saw the inflamed world.A bird sang deeply from the gutter eaves.When I closed my eyes I was elsewhere.I walked through the fire of his sleep.leaving early My Love,    tonight Fionnuala is your nurse. You’ll hear her voice sing-song around the ward lifting a wing at the shore of your darkness. I heard that, in another life, she too journeyed through a storm, a kind of curse, with the ocean rising darkly around her, fierce with cold, and no resting place, only the frozen rocks that tore her feet, the light on her shoulders. And no cure there but to wait it out. If, while I’m gone, your fever comes down— if the small, salt-laden shapes of her song appear as a first glimmer of earth-light, follow the sweet, hopeful voice of that landing. She will keep you safe beneath her wing.in your sleep After “The Lark Ascending” by Ralph Vaughan Williams The moment the lark finally vanishes into the spread green sky of the forest is the moment you suddenly lift your bruised arm up, over your body, as though to show me the wing’s eclipse, or the wing, or the season of your dream. And even as your hand lapses silent onto your chest, and your breath goes sluggish, I am already watching your feet prepare their slow first step under the sheet as the last notes of sunlight fall quiet, and you do not move again. My love, are you a bird reviving in a summer field? Was it the lark ascending that you heard, a ghost among its shy-hearted tunes? Yes. I heard the lark escaping, too.

There were seven colors of mourning, one was lilac. That kind of blossomalways has its crowd, fanned out, surroundedby crushing likeness, smell of itself.  Fabric has to breathe, at least 2%, like skin.  A little milkfat, elastane even in the gravest print. Not knowing how to grieve can poisonlike a directionless dart. And although fabric has been known to swirl and clasp, be clasped —   without mother there’s only art. To hug the body: a swath, anathema, magical, seventies lace and spacedust, all too far gone to truly love. But to twist it, to learn to hate-want. To sway, tear, burrow, be borrowed, everybody’s animal. To float like water seeking its own,stampede like buffalo, seeking its hide.Face painted on torso on horsehairon chesty silk it’s a deathmaskfor the stigmata slash of the model’s body. • I don’t think I understand what studying is. I listen, I read, I remember, I absorb. I let myself be moved and changed. Is that “studying?” Never five-fingered, you never use them all,  gloves will be like hooves, split-footed, hand-stitched. When concept perceived — a womanly gist, let’s say,or a curve of mind — is more than itself (surpassing,all maw) I make it part of me. I take it in, drink a corrosive. I let it overtake me, change everything it can, lip to tip to rim. My eyes just drink the fabric that coverseach surface of this world. Suck up the plastic through a polished straw. Everything’s inspiration: trees reflected in windows on buildings, distorted busesendless frames, all too glass, so much lens, textures so tall, and once you start to see things this way,vision’s a performance, shocking and true after all these centuries, a Shakespearean volta, like nectar is poison to the occasional queen bee. Everything actually is blurred, not just how you see. Glasses and shoes are solutionsto problems that are real problems, that of blurred world, that of touching the ground. A glass corset for the heart to see out its chest. For without glasses, the eye better seesthe wind, by feeling it and closing against its grains, its grasses. For without shoes, my feet become shoes. When I am really feeling,I get very tired, I fall asleep for the seventeenth timeon the unfinished skirt of glass eyes and lemon  zest hemmed first, grown last. I experience the world as infiniteinvertedness: no wholes broken, just potential fragments straining, skull-like,at the seams. Anything could give.But no, just takes and takes and takes. • I’ve been trying to write the words, “I cried. Cried reallyand wetly, and for good.” Old-fashionedwriting with intense excitement:the spell of quill and ink spill, quelled. What is beautiful, what is terrifying,what is absurd in me? Every possibility that colors are believable, various, not that mirage I thought I’d seen and can be held apart as unreal,too exterior, distinct from each other wildly as sparks to seaweedor flower to meteor. It collapsed, can’t draw it can’t cut it out of itself. There is no color but what’s alreadyinside the eye, no power or invention or new way to wake up in the morning outside the seeing mechanism, our own orbs. Yet I can’t see myself.I can never see you again. I can only see from inside my skulland when I look down I close everything not just my eyes. I wrap my own tender nether flesh in calfskin leather so buttery, melted back together like so: a newborn softenedin its own mother’s milk.• I awoke in a panic (no ma no ma) to the smallest day yet.I dreamed I alreadydreamed all the dreams I’d get. This morning I dressed in my last dress’s last dress, fit only for a genteel gothic murder, covered up well — airtight,would only fit the stabbed one, after bloodlet.Then, like a glove. Who wears it and where?I will, from the bed to the chair. Headrest, clotheshorse.Designer and model: mutually orbiting the best metaphor for bodiless idea. Amorphous, amorous, amoral, immortal. Red is dead, said blue, to you too? Hindquarter-gauze with silver face clampand sickened ears pulled, unskulled. Broken backpiece. Shadow sensible by other than sight. To smell a shadow.To strike it. To trace it later, to measure a body by its line. Light’s so quiet. You’d think its cuttings, its edge-hole,those mousy children, would squeakat least a bit. They run like a stockingdown the leg of the mind. Why not quieter then? There is no body without life.There is no mind without body.There is no without.

what a soul is, I think of it
as the smallest, the core, civil right. And she
is wild now with it, she touches and is
touched by no one knows — down, or
droppings of a common nighthawk,
root of bird’s foot fern, antenna of
Hairstreak or Echo Azure, or stepped on by the
huge translucent Jerusalem cricket. There was
something deeply right about
the physical elements — atoms, and cells,
and marrow — of my mother’s body,
when I was young, and now her delicate
insignias receive the direct
touch of the sun, and scatter it,
unseen, all over her home.
 
 2. cross and dove  
I had not wanted them, and I hadn’t known
what to do with them, the minuscule
symbols of my mother’s religion,
I looked for a crack in the stone floor of the
cathedral but could not find one. Then I thought
of the wilderness near Desolation,
and asked my friend to carry them up
to a peak of granite, and let the wind take them. Since
then, it has been as if my mother’s
spirit matter has been returned
into the great bank of matter,
as her marrow had been sifted down into
the ocean. It doesn’t matter, now, if I
ever wanted to disassemble
my mother. The sixteenth-of-an-inch-
across cross, and the silver line drawing
of a dove are cached, somewhere, that is nowhere
to be found. Now I think of the nature of metal, and how
long the soul-dolls of her trust will last in their
spider-egg-sac of roots, needles,
quartz, feathers, dust, snow, shed
claw. Her belief she would have an eternal
life was absolute, I think.
It would not be good to think of my mother
without her God — like a hermit howling in the
moonscape of a desert. Once, when she was old — like an
exquisite child playing a crone
in the school play — we talked about heaven.
She wasn’t sure exactly how, but she
knew her father would be there, and her elder
brother, and her second husband —
maybe it was a heaven for four,
the three men and her. It was so
easy to make my mother happy
in her last years, to tell her that I
could just see her, as a kitten, in God’s
lap, being petted. Her eyes sparkled with more
beams than any other eyes I have seen.
I have sent the tokens of her everlasting being
into the high altitude.
They will shine long after I can sing her — sing what I
perceived through the distorted prisms of my vision.
I don’t know if I saw my mother
or did not see her. Day and night,
her charms will gleam in the brush or stream, will
reflect the mountain light in little
pieces of unreadable language.

For I find no flattering explanation for the murder of everyone.
Flames consume the head, hands, and feet in the mural by Orozco.
Because monks don’t even eat meat.
His clothes made him torch; still Thích Quảng Đức’s heart would not fire.
Because his remains stiffened when they tried to place him in a tomb.
Because what is the point of murdering everyone in the world?
Since the sun sets in Vietnam before it reaches the West.
Because aren’t the faceless Mexicans always the ones we martyr?
Why do heretic Indians hurry to incinerate themselves at the stake?
Are you awake enough to remember how we clarify the skin of our slaves?
To feel the fingers of the children of thread flame stitching your voluminous rugs?
The candles in the basilica flicker when they channel the nightmares of the dead.
Because Jiménez wept when the mammoth blue mustang leg fell from heaven, rupturing the artery in his leg.
Because of Chinese soldiers armed to protect Tiananmen Square from monks burning to set themselves ablaze.

For Harry Gamboa,   Jr. 
Just a tick ago, the actor was a Roman candle
shot to the sky, smudged by rain’s helter-
skelter. His motivation was: he’s a stooge
on L.A.’s sodden turnpike, so we have “to make” art. Got
to rezone and react. The world the bare wall to
his bullet. Got to rile up the populace, to fortify
the arsenal. Once in a while, repopulate and penetrate,
paint a list of incitement onto the walls.
An elder told him that to overturn the city, one must
surrender body/belongings to the one explosive
spectacle of truth, making it ongoing. Pay attention.
To overturn the city, not just the scraps but fervor itself.
Not just the wan broadcast of indignation but
IRL incursions into the workhouses and
poorhouses to inflame the thousand points of  light.
A lean surge, departure pinks both ends of  him.
He’s the nth layer folded into the stand’s nerve.

She is approaching him, God, he sees her

He waits for her to become
what he has made her, an angel, passionate
and cold as the dawn,
quietly encased in power,
churning out neutral love and fastened to eternity,
backwards and forwards all the days.
But the world is tangled in her hair.
She is getting closer
and her gold beauty is greening, her face is turning
furious, fury-like, her death
opens around him
and he feels a human fear.
He cannot match her, she has the reins
of creation in her slim white paws, he feels the world
creeping away from him. He makes

But he cannot grip her.

He gives breath, as if an afterthought.
Ezekiel tries to see in their eyes, one at a time.

eyes ice cold mud seen through mist,
waiting for their souls to snap back in.
They are bruised with an ache
made not by the world.
Their forgotten stories rift their faces,
their deaths now a hole they can walk through.

If rigor mortis sets in
it means there’s somebody who needs it.
It means that somebody
is drained and not awake
and deems any speckles of life unusable
and he is dead and dead
all dead in the humus
of trashed bodies shoved down there
dressed in made-up relationships.
What’s your favorite part?
Mine’s every part
with a maggot in it. Maggots
mean that life’s still leaking.
It’s like magic
when his dead voice
is nauseating
and I can’t see him
so he might as well be invisible.
It’s like magic when he isn’t
and doesn’t have anything to say
and I can’t bear to listen anyway
so I just recognize my fingers / all
the injuries they’ve inflicted
while my skin drops off.
What’s worse than a maggot
in the EAT ME

Does the 5-second rule apply
to something that drops dead?
Is it true he might come back
and crack open a piñata
blue alcopops, bombay mix, karaoke, and a pint of nostalgia
which is like thinking in another language,
I mean, how it feels, not what it means.
Half a maggot, the memory of
mange marching across his fur
describes a lot of other feelings
the feeling that someone else is taking up the whole room
the feeling that no one could help me now
or ever whether I was on several edges
my hot core and noggin facing this hammering world
of brainlessness and sweetbreads
was always a favorite word.

Who concocts the smell
of dogs which smells like
an extreme close-up
of the world oozing
in at the edges.
Full as an ice cube is full of liquid.

The world is too full of smells.

I was making a new friend,
blonde-gray, a living opal,
pellucid, also reminding me
of a green apple
napping underneath its tree,
where I have tumbled too,
being of an age, “elderly”
but undepressed, she
tall enough to change
the smoke alarm — sharing
a ripeness that we liked comparing,
bosses who couldn’t see us,
perforation by divorce,
retirement, and stairs.
One lunch that I was looking forward to,
the first thing on her mind — 
“Do you believe in the Occult?” — 
“Merline! No, I don’t think so.”
She was in an auditorium — 
her older, deader sister sat
right down beside her
with a message — a large figure
not her body but a sum — 
what did it mean? I’d thought
one of us leaned forward at the lectern
but a ghost was there, holding sway,
or forth. Well, it came true — 
she’s richer by that sum — 
and urges making sure
to be attentive to my dreams.
She knows that it will happen — 
I’m her friend, as the Occult has been so far.
I didn’t want my brother
appearing in a dream
to bring me news of unexpected
income — if only I would pray
about it first — to the God
who had my brother die
after all. And certainly not
my sister prophesying ill
on my behalf. I guess I’d stand up,
put on a mike, look out at all
the empty faces, make them
look alive, and even cheer.
Had I remembered a firsthand poltergeist,
a temptatious legend ... 
I guess I’d accept a sleek Angora bunny
in a mohair hat, or magic
like a two-dollar bill, ask for
a life my brother could have back.

prologue


With a sharp comb dipped in ink I’ve tattooed my life story all over my body. I’ve tattooed the footprints of my children — this way  I carry their walking with me; the footprints of my twins who died before their feet touched the ground. And the footprints of my one-year-old son, James, whom I pray for daily.
 
 
i: dent-de-lion

Because I bore the lion of my father’s country
my Maries and I picked dandelions —
    lion’s teeth.
All our childhood we picked them —
blowball, cankerwort,
doon-head-clock, witch’s gowan,
monk’s head, priest’s crown, worm roseMary Queen of Scots
Mary Queen of Scots
I held their gold beneath my chin;
imagined the lion rampant — its tongue,
its claws on my skin.
When I find the tallest stalk
I know how much I’ll grow.
I weave their sun bells
into my wedding bouquet. When I blow
seeds from the puffball
and three remain —
three children will I bear.Mary Queen of Scots
Mary Queen of Scots
 
 
ii: the caulbearer

When he was born
a shimmer of womb-skin
stretched across his face —
     I knew then
he would always be
with me.
I carried the caul
through all my years in captivity.
I imagined the membrane
attached to his plump baby face
like a coral headdress;
    I spoke to it,
willed it to carry my letters,
my messages into the drowning
depths of his night sleeping head.
 
 
iii: daffadowndilly

Despite the westerly gales,
despite the persistence of snowfall
the daffodils are opening.
They are opening
the way tapestries, labored at
one stitch at a time, suddenly arrive
at something whole.
Mary is stitching her name
over and over, pulling
the threads through
her long fingers.
For nineteen years
her name has been a plaything.
The ends of her fingers weave
puns and anagrams.
She is a woman
of many names —
she has woven a self
to match each name —
Tu te Marieras
Veritas Armata
Sa Vertue M’attire
Tu as Martyre
And the daffodils, they too
have many names —
Daffadowndilly, Narcissus,
Lenten lily, Easter bell.
How they weave themselves
out of the grass, out
of the green shoots
and sheathed leaves;
heads hung, necks
waiting to be snapped.
 
 
iv: the mermaid and the hare

Though all my life
I’ve worn dresses of mohair,
damask, or serge, stiffened in the neck
    with buckram;
though I wear breeding layers
of petticoats, farthingales
expanded with hoops of whalebone;
they’ve removed my heart-shaped cap,
my mourning veil, stripped
me bare to the waist,
replaced my silver hose-covered legs
with the wet mucus of a fish tail.
Two husbands dead —
they visit me nightly.
In dreams my hands turn into gudgeons,
chubs, loaches; the white magic
of a hare biting at my heels.
 
 
v: snowdrops

When they are ready
they send for her.
There are so many of them —
men who must watch her die.
The snowdrops outside her window
change color in the sunrise.
She is tired. She has lain awake all night.
She is dressed in black
with a long white veil — a caul
to keep her son close to her.
She counts the pearl acorn buttons
on her satin dress;
she counts the double string of rosary
hanging from her waist.
Her God is ready for her;
his body hangs above her
and she carries his cross
into the great hall.
Pearl queen —
she imagines the hall is filled with pearls
and the pearls are snowdrops.
Into the sheer purity of it she will fall.
She is going into the arms
of her mother.
In blood she came, in blood she will go —
stripped to red petticoat,
red bodice, red sleeves.
She feels herself glowing
in the center of the hall —
sister to the fireplace;
curls burning around her pale face,
her auburn eyes.
Hunkering for final prayer
she commits herself, kneels to the block;
hot fur, breath, the pounding
heart of her lapdog
pressing against her leg.
She gasps as the phoenix in her chest
breaks apart her body
with two blows —
one from each wing
as it rose.
 
 
vi: red and white

Though it was the color of mourning,
for my wedding I wanted to wear white —
The color of fresh snow and milk
The color of Isis and for wrapping the dead
The color cloaking the early monks
The color of the sacrificial lamb
The color of the transfiguration of our Lord
The color of the unicorn
My colors are red and white —
a white veil flows from my pale face
and tight red curls.
When I walk in the garden I scatter sunlight.
I am titanium white
I am Sirius
I am an Arctic fox
My heart is ermine
I am a white horse ridden by Conquest;
you will remember my name.

I wish there had been more stories
like the one about the origin of her disliking tea
            at 17, she went to celebrate being made teacher
            of the one-room school she had attended and
            graduated from at her retiring teacher’s
            home, she was served for the first time — tea, she
            being from a German coffee-drinking family.
            Our mother hated it but politely choked it down.
            Would never again touch a drop of the
            poisonous beverage.
From that story, we learned that
our mother ritualized hating something — expected us
to admire her for it.
                        I took
                        that negative pattern
                        and spun it until I could have cloth enough

I left all my family — you were part of it — 
left California and reinvented myself, even
mythologized myself as a tan “California Girl.”
You did not become an artist or a poet.
I suppose that’s why you felt damaged.
If only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice
it took for me to get away.
                        So many small things
                                   can save us

Easter Sunday. You and I always dyed
Easter eggs together, our mother busy at
her forty-hour-a-week bookkeeper’s job. I 
was intrigued with the colors,
but they never turned out so bright when
coloring the eggs. You, the artist,
were interested in the designs
to transfer onto the eggs,
cartoons, bunnies,
chicks.
We kept our eggs
separated from each other,
put them in separate bowls, neither
caring for the other’s creation. Still we
felt connected, even joyful, on those few holiday projects.
Not enough to make us friends.
My unwillingness to be like our classmates
embarrassed you. You chose invisibility
in school, rather than being known as “Diane’s
Sister.” 
That unwillingness to be like others 
was what made me a poet. So many little things, but that early decision
of yours, not to understand why I wanted to be weird,
is what made you make so 
many other small choices, preventing you 
from becoming an artist. “Look away,” our mother said to us,
when there were ugly things confronting us. 
I could not do that. You blame
our mother, yet it was you who decided to look away,
even though it meant not seeing the whole world,
even if meant you didn’t become an artist.
Poverty, of course, was the reason
we never had nice shoes.

I have in my wrist a black bump that
protrudes near a vein.
                                    It’s the point of a pencil
that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled
for the long yellow weapon.
A pencil, the weapon of a writer. But there was 
no bleeding, no seeming-wound to be dressed. 
We never told
our Mother, both too ashamed
of our brutality. I’ve never asked a doctor
about it, the pencil lead encapsulated
in my wrist. Nor ever spoken
of it to anyone.
I always wonder that so much must remain a secret?

Drinking
a blend of traditional
Darjeeling with a touch of Ceylon / this
tea takes me back to a Viennese visit, drinking
this very tea in the afternoon while my friend, Jonathan,
ate their famous Sacher torte.
The tea
seemed particularly aromatic — 
            “lightly scented with oil of bergamot
            and a hint of genuine Bourbon vanilla.”
Wishing for the moment in the past to reappear. I didn’t know

was as famous as the cake
                                until I found in my Upton Tea catalogue

                                under the heading “Earl Grey Blends”
This tea,
any cup of tea!
Hard to believe. no! Sad to
think my Mother almost spat out her first taste
of tea.
What worldly thing must I touch to
bring Marilyn back into my
sedate life, my sister Marilyn who died in January? 
Her hand — I’d like to imagine timidly touching her
      hand — Marilyn’s hand.
            Her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring.
                        In that hand she’d be holding a cigarette.

We were thirty-one souls all, he said, on the gray-sick of sea
in a cold rubber boat, rising and falling in our filth.
By morning this didn’t matter, no land was in sight,
all were soaked to the bone, living and dead.
We could still float, we said, from war to war.
What lay behind us but ruins of stone piled on ruins of stone?
City called “mother of the poor” surrounded by fields
of cotton and millet, city of jewelers and cloak-makers,
with the oldest church in Christendom and the Sword of Allah.
If anyone remains there now, he assures, they would be utterly alone.
There is a hotel named for it in Rome two hundred meters
from the Piazza di Spagna, where you can have breakfast under
the portraits of film stars. There the staff cannot do enough for you.
But I am talking nonsense again, as I have since that night
we fetched a child, not ours, from the sea, drifting face-
down in a life vest, its eyes taken by fish or the birds above us.
After that, Aleppo went up in smoke, and Raqqa came under a rain
of leaflets warning everyone to go. Leave, yes, but go where?
We lived through the Americans and Russians, through Americans
again, many nights of death from the clouds, mornings surprised
to be waking from the sleep of death, still unburied and alive
but with no safe place. Leave, yes, we obey the leaflets, but go where?
To the sea to be eaten, to the shores of Europe to be caged?
To camp misery and camp remain here. I ask you then, where?
You tell me you are a poet. If so, our destination is the same.
I find myself now the boatman, driving a taxi at the end of the world.

Marionette means little Mary.

Think of all the porn-dollies moving their mouths up and down on wood and the way the men jerk, responding as they’re made to, and the clear wires. The men who make up cyborgs, beautiful and silver-skulled with wet mouths that might deliver quick blue shocks. Think of Eve’s small teeth kinking apple flesh and who put it there and who suggested and who lifted her wrist. Think of shadow puppets with enormous penises. Think of little boys shot for holding up toy guns. Think of animals compared to puppets by Aristotle — how levers are released and strike the twisted sinews against one another. Think of people compared to animals. Think of men on a bus forcing instruments so far inside a girl they puppet the girl to death and puppet means pulled by tendons.

Butch once remarked to me how sinister it was   
alone, after hours, in the dark of the shop
to find me there hunched over two weeks’ accounts   
probably smoked like a bacon from all those Pall-Malls.
Odd comfort when the light goes, the case lights left on   
and the rings of baloney, the herring, the parsley,   
arranged in the strict, familiar ways.
Whatever intactness holds animals up
has been carefully taken, what’s left are the parts.   
Just look in the cases, all counted and stacked.
Step-and-a-Half Waleski used to come to the shop
and ask for the cheap cut, she would thump, sniff, and finger.   
This one too old. This one here for my supper.   
Two days and you do notice change in the texture.
I have seen them the day before slaughter.
Knowing the outcome from the moment they enter   
the chute, the eye rolls, blood is smeared on the lintel.   
Mallet or bullet they lunge toward their darkness.

When a child is born, sometimes the left hand is stronger.   
You can train it to fail, still the knowledge is there.   
That is the knowledge in the hand of a butcher
that adds to its weight. Otto Kröger could fell
a dray horse with one well-placed punch to the jaw,   
and yet it is well known how thorough he was.
He never sat down without washing his hands,   
and he was a maker, his sausage was echt
so that even Waleski had little complaint.   
Butch once remarked there was no one so deft   
as my Otto. So true, there is great tact involved   
in parting the flesh from the bones that it loves.
How we cling to the bones. Each joint is a web
of small tendons and fibers. He knew what I meant

Why in this short life,

He had never planned to stay,   
the boy who helped to build   
the railroads for a dollar a day.   
He had always meant to go back.   
When did he finally know

dispossessed,

these landlocked, makeshift ghost towns?

1 Sometime now past in the Autumnal Tide, When Phoebus wanted but one hour to bed, The trees all richly clad, yet void of pride, Were gilded o’re by his rich golden head. Their leaves and fruits seem’d painted but was true Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew, Rapt were my senses at this delectable view. 2 I wist not what to wish, yet sure thought I, If so much excellence abide below, How excellent is he that dwells on high? Whose power and beauty by his works we know. Sure he is goodness, wisdom, glory, light, That hath this under world so richly dight. More Heaven than Earth was here, no winter and no night. 3 Then on a stately Oak I cast mine Eye, Whose ruffling top the Clouds seem’d to aspire; How long since thou wast in thine Infancy? Thy strength and stature, more thy years admire, Hath hundred winters past since thou wast born? Or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn, If so, all these as nought, Eternity doth scorn. 4 Then higher on the glistering Sun I gaz’d, Whose beams was shaded by the leafy Tree. The more I look’d, the more I grew amaz’d And softly said, what glory’s like to thee? Soul of this world, this Universe’s Eye, No wonder some made thee a Deity: Had I not better known (alas) the same had I. 5 Thou as a Bridegroom from thy Chamber rushes And as a strong man joys to run a race. The morn doth usher thee with smiles and blushes. The Earth reflects her glances in thy face. Birds, insects, Animals with Vegative, Thy heat from death and dullness doth revive: And in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive. 6 Thy swift Annual and diurnal Course, Thy daily straight and yearly oblique path, Thy pleasing fervour, and thy scorching force, All mortals here the feeling knowledge hath. Thy presence makes it day, thy absence night, Quaternal seasons caused by thy might: Hail Creature, full of sweetness, beauty, and delight. 7 Art thou so full of glory that no Eye Hath strength thy shining Rays once to behold? And is thy splendid Throne erect so high? As, to approach it, can no earthly mould. How full of glory then must thy Creator be? Who gave this bright light luster unto thee: Admir’d, ador’d for ever be that Majesty. 8 Silent alone where none or saw, or heard, In pathless paths I lead my wand’ring feet. My humble Eyes to lofty Skies I rear’d To sing some Song my mazed Muse thought meet. My great Creator I would magnifie, That nature had thus decked liberally: But Ah and Ah again, my imbecility! 9 I heard the merry grasshopper then sing, The black clad Cricket bear a second part. They kept one tune and played on the same string, Seeming to glory in their little Art. Shall creatures abject thus their voices raise? And in their kind resound their maker’s praise: Whilst I, as mute, can warble forth no higher layes. 10 When present times look back to Ages past And men in being fancy those are dead, It makes things gone perpetually to last And calls back months and years that long since fled It makes a man more aged in conceit, Than was Methuselah or’s grand-sire great: While of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat. 11 Sometimes in Eden fair he seems to be, See glorious Adam there made Lord of all, Fancies the Apple, dangle on the Tree, That turn’d his Sovereign to a naked thrall, Who like a miscreant’s driven from that place To get his bread with pain and sweat of face: A penalty impos’d on his backsliding Race. 12 Here sits our Grandame in retired place, And in her lap her bloody Cain new born, The weeping Imp oft looks her in the face, Bewails his unknown hap and fate forlorn; His Mother sighs to think of Paradise, And how she lost her bliss, to be more wise, Believing him that was, and is, Father of lyes. 13 Here Cain and Abel come to sacrifice, Fruits of the Earth and Fatlings each do bring, On Abels gift the fire descends from Skies, But no such sign on false Cain’s offering; With sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes. Hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes, Upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise. 14 There Abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks, His brother comes, then acts his fratricide. The Virgin Earth of blood her first draught drinks, But since that time she often hath been cloy’d; The wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind, Thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind, Though none on Earth but kindred near then could he find. 15 Who fancies not his looks now at the Barr, His face like death, his heart with horror fraught, Nor Male-factor ever felt like warr, When deep despair with wish of life hath fought, Branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes, A Vagabond to Land of Nod he goes. A City builds, that wals might him secure from foes. 16 Who thinks not oft upon the Fathers ages. Their long descent, how nephews sons they saw, The starry observations of those Sages, And how their precepts to their sons were law, How Adam sigh’d to see his Progeny, Cloath’d all in his black, sinful Livery, Who neither guilt not yet the punishment could fly. 17 Our Life compare we with their length of dayes Who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive? And though thus short, we shorten many wayes, Living so little while we are alive; In eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight So unawares comes on perpetual night, And puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight. 18 When I behold the heavens as in their prime, And then the earth (though old) still clad in green, The stones and trees, insensible of time, Nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen; If winter come, and greenness then do fade, A Spring returns, and they more youthfull made; But Man grows old, lies down, remains where once he’s laid. 19 By birth more noble than those creatures all, Yet seems by nature and by custom curs’d, No sooner born, but grief and care makes fall That state obliterate he had at first: Nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again Nor habitations long their names retain, But in oblivion to the final day remain. 20 Shall I then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth Because their beauty and their strength last longer Shall I wish there, or never to had birth, Because they’re bigger and their bodyes stronger? Nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and dye, And when unmade, so ever shall they lye, But man was made for endless immortality. 21 Under the cooling shadow of a stately Elm Close sate I by a goodly Rivers side, Where gliding streams the Rocks did overwhelm; A lonely place, with pleasures dignifi’d. I once that lov’d the shady woods so well, Now thought the rivers did the trees excel, And if the sun would ever shine, there would I dwell. 22 While on the stealing stream I fixt mine eye, Which to the long’d-for Ocean held its course, I markt, nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lye Could hinder ought but still augment its force: O happy Flood, quoth I, that holds thy race Till thou arrive at thy beloved place, Nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace. 23 Nor is’t enough that thou alone may’st slide, But hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet, So hand in hand along with thee they glide To Thetis house, where all imbrace and greet: Thou Emblem true of what I count the best, O could I lead my Rivolets to rest, So may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest. 24 Ye Fish which in this liquid Region ’bide That for each season have your habitation, Now salt, now fresh where you think best to glide To unknown coasts to give a visitation, In Lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry, So Nature taught, and yet you know not why, You watry folk that know not your felicity. 25 Look how the wantons frisk to tast the air, Then to the colder bottome streight they dive, Eftsoon to Neptun’s glassy Hall repair To see what trade they, great ones, there do drive, Who forrage o’re the spacious sea-green field, And take the trembling prey before it yield, Whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield. 26 While musing thus with contemplation fed, And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain, The sweet-tongu’d Philomel percht ore my head, And chanted forth a most melodious strain Which rapt me so with wonder and delight, I judg’d my hearing better than my sight, And wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight. 27 O merry Bird (said I) that fears no snares, That neither toyles nor hoards up in thy barn, Feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating cares To gain more good, or shun what might thee harm Thy clothes ne’re wear, thy meat is every where, Thy bed a bough, thy drink the water cleer, Reminds not what is past, nor whats to come dost fear. 28 The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent, Sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew, So each one tunes his pretty instrument, And warbling out the old, begin anew, And thus they pass their youth in summer season, Then follow thee into a better Region, Where winter’s never felt by that sweet airy legion. 29 Man at the best a creature frail and vain, In knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak, Subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain, Each storm his state, his mind, his body break, From some of these he never finds cessation, But day or night, within, without, vexation, Troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near’st Relation. 30 And yet this sinfull creature, frail and vain, This lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow, This weather-beaten vessel wrackt with pain, Joys not in hope of an eternal morrow; Nor all his losses, crosses and vexation, In weight, in frequency and long duration Can make him deeply groan for that divine Translation. 31 The Mariner that on smooth waves doth glide, Sings merrily and steers his Barque with ease, As if he had command of wind and tide, And now becomes great Master of the seas; But suddenly a storm spoils all the sport, And makes him long for a more quiet port, Which ’gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort. 32 So he that faileth in this world of pleasure, Feeding on sweets, that never bit of th’ sowre, That’s full of friends, of honour and of treasure, Fond fool, he takes this earth ev’n for heav’ns bower, But sad affliction comes and makes him see Here’s neither honour, wealth, nor safety; Only above is found all with security. 33 O Time the fatal wrack of mortal things, That draws oblivions curtains over kings, Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not, Their names without a Record are forgot, Their parts, their ports, their pomp’s all laid in th’ dust. Nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings scape times rust; But he whose name is grav’d in the white stone Shall last and shine when all of these are gone.

Somebody’s baby was laid out to rest,       White as a snowdrop, and fair to behold, And the soft little hands were crossed over the breast,       And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were pressed With kisses as hot as the eyelids were cold. Somebody saw it go out of her sight,       Under the coffin lid—out through the door; Somebody finds only darkness and blight       All through the glory of summer-sun light; Somebody’s baby will waken no more. Somebody’s sorrow is making me weep:       I know not her name, but I echo her cry, For the dearly bought baby she longed so to keep,       The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep In the little white hearse that went rumbling by. I know not her name, but her sorrow I know;       While I paused on the crossing I lived it once more, And back to my heart surged that river of woe       That but in the breast of a mother can flow; For the little white hearse has been, too, at my door.

Until her face shone pure of fault
From the forehead to the chin.

To make it more desired.

about your huntsman’s bow, opera, baseball,
endless games of chess in the dorm parlor with you
boasting your prowess.

“Feel me to do right,” our father said on his deathbed.
We did not quite know—in fact, not at all—what he meant.
His last whisper was spent as through a slot in a wall.
He left us a key, but how did it fit? “Feel me
to do right.” Did it mean that, though he died, he would be felt
through some aperture, or by some unseen instrument
our dad just then had come to know? So, to do right always,
we need but feel his spirit? Or was it merely his apology
for dying? “Feel that I do right in not trying,
as you insist, to stay on your side. There is the wide
gateway and the splendid tower, and you implore me
to wait here, with the worms!”
Had he defined his terms, and could we discriminate
among his motives, we might have found out how to “do right”
before we died—supposing he felt he suddenly knew
what dying was. “You do wrong because you do not feel
as I do now” was maybe the sense. “Feel me, and emulate
my state, for I am becoming less dense—I am feeling right
for the first time.” And then the vessel burst,
and we were kneeling around an emptiness.
We cannot feel our father now. His power courses through us,
yes, but he—the chest and cheek, the foot and palm,
the mouth of oracle—is calm. And we still seek
his meaning. “Feel me,” he said, and emphasized that word.
Should we have heard it as a plea for a caress—
a constant caress, since flesh to flesh was all that we
could do right if we would bless him?
The dying must feel the pressure of that question—
lying flat, turning cold from brow to heel—the hot
cowards there above protesting their love, and saying,
“What can we do? Are you all right?” While the wall opens
and the blue night pours through. “What can we do?
We want to do what’s right.”

with me. Feel with me. Feel me to do right.”

Saturday, April 5. Welles’s Othello:
black and white grid of rage,
steam of sheer fury spewing from the vent
of violence that followed where they went.
Wind howled on the battlements, but sun
gilded glum canals. The lovers floated
beneath black bridges, coupled in stone rooms.
The unrepentant villain (at the start
so all the rest was flashback)
dangled from a cage
squinting inscrutably at the funeral
procession winding through the town below.
The air was full of wailing.
Knives of sunlight glittered on the sea.
We lurched out onto Fifty-Seventh Street.
You said “I think I’m dying.”
Next week your eyes went out.
Shining under the lamp,
your blue gaze, now opaque,
your face drawn sharper but still beautiful:
from this extremity you can attempt
to rise to rage and grief. Or you can yield
to the cozy quicksand of the bed.
You wave your hand at walls of books:
“What do I do? Do I throw all these away?”
Their anecdotes, their comforts—now black glass.

In the coolness here I care
Not for the down-pressed noises overhead,
I hear in my pearly bone the wear
Of marble under the rain; nothing is truly dead,
There is only the wearing away,
The changing of means. Nor eyes I have
To tell how in the summer the mourning dove
Rocks on the hemlock’s arm, nor ears to rend
The sad regretful mind
With the call of the horned lark.
I lie so still that the earth around me
Shakes with the weight of day;
I do not mind if the vase
Holds decomposed cut flowers, or if they send
One of their kind to tidy up. Such play
I have no memories of,
Nor of the fire-bush flowers, or the bark
Of the rough pine where the crows
With their great haw and flap
Circle in kinned excitement when a wind blows.
I am kin with none of these,
Nor even wed to the yellowing silk that splits;
My sensitive bones, which dreaded,
As all the living do, the dead,
Wait for some unappointed pattern. The wits
Of countless centuries dry in my skull and overhead
I do not heed the first rain out of winter,
Nor do I care what they have planted. At my center
The bone glistens; of wondrous bones I am made;
And alone shine in a phosphorous glow,
So, in this little plot where I am laid.

That year there were many deaths in the village. Germs flew like angels from one house to the next and every family gave up its own. Mothers died at their mending. Children fell at school. Of three hundred twenty, there were eleven left. Then, quietly, the sun set on a day when no one died. And the angels whispered among themselves. And that evening, as he sat on the stone steps, your grandfather felt a small wind on his neck when all the trees were still. And he would tell us always, how he had felt that night, on the skin of his own neck, the angels, passing.

They are a gift I have wanted again.
Wanted: One moment in mountains
when winter got so cold
the oil froze before it could burn.
I chopped ferns of hoarfrost from all the windows
and peered up at pines, a wedding cake
by a baker gone mad. Swirls by the thousand
shimmered above me until a cloud
lumbered over a ridge,
bringing the heavier white of more flurries.
I believed, I believed, I believed
it would last, that when you went out
to test the black ice or to dig out a Volkswagon
filled with rich women, you’d return
and we’d sputter like oil,
match after match, warm in the making.
Wisconsin’s flat farmland never approved:
I hid in cornfields far into October,
listening to music that whirled from my thumbprint.
When sunset played havoc with bright leaves of alders,
I never mentioned longing or fear.
I crouched like a good refugee in brown creeks
and forgot why Autumn is harder than Spring.
But snug on the western slope of that mountain
I’d accept every terror, break open seals
to release love’s headwaters to unhurried sunlight.
Weren’t we Big Hearts? Through some trick of silver
we held one another, believing each motion the real one,
ah, lover, why were dark sources bundled up
in our eyes? Each owned an agate,
marbled with anguish, a heart or its echo,
we hardly knew. Lips touching lips,
did that break my horizon
as much as those horses broke my belief?
You drove off and I walked the old road,
scolding the doubles that wanted so much.
The chestnut mare whinnied a cloud into scrub pine.
In a windless corner of a corral,
four horses fit like puzzle pieces.
Their dark eyes and lashes defined by the white.
The colt kicked his hind, loped from the fence.
The mares and a stallion galloped behind,
lifting and leaping, finding each other
in full accord with the earth and their bodies.
No harm ever touched them once they cut loose,
snorting at flurries falling again.
How little our chances for feeling ourselves.
They vanished so quickly—one flick of a tail.
Where do their mountains and moments begin?
I stood a long time in sharpening wind.

There is a button on the remote control called FAV. You can program your favorite channels. Don’t like the world you live in, choose one closer to the world you live in. I choose the independent film channel and HBO. Neither have news programs as far as I can tell. This is what is great about America—anyone can make these kinds of choices. Instead of the news, HBO has The Sopranos. This week the indie channel is playing and replaying Spaghetti Westerns. Always someone gets shot or pierced through the heart with an arrow, and just before he dies he says, I am not going to make it. Where? Not going to make it where? On some level, maybe, the phrase simply means not going to make it into the next day, hour, minute, or perhaps the next second. Occasionally, you can imagine, it means he is not going to make it to Carson City or Texas or somewhere else out west or to Mexico if he is on the run. On another level always implicit is the sense that it means he is not going to make it to his own death. Perhaps in the back of all our minds is the life expectancy for our generation. Perhaps this expectation lingers there alongside the hours of sleep one should get or the number of times one is meant to chew food—eight hours, twenty chews, and seventy-six years. We are all heading there and not to have that birthday is not to have made it.

                ","
A father tells his son the thing he regrets most about his life is the amount of time he has spent worrying about it.
   

Worry 1. A dog’s action of biting and shaking an animal so as to injure or kill it, spec., a hound’s worrying of its quarry; an instance of this. 2. A state or feeling of mental unease or anxiety regarding or arising from one’s cares or responsibilities, uncertainty about the future, fear of failure, etc.; anxious concern, anxiety. Also, an instance or cause of this.
 

It achieved nothing, all his worrying. Things worked out or they didn’t work out and now here he was, an old man, an old man who each year of his life bit or shook doubt as if to injure if not to kill, an old man with a good-looking son who resembles his deceased mother. It is uncanny how she rests there, as plain as day, in their boy's face.
   

Worry 8. Cause mental distress or agitation to (a person, oneself); make anxious and ill at ease. 9. Give way to anxiety, unease, or disquietude: allow one’s mind to dwell on difficulties or troubles.
 

He waits for his father’s death. His father has been taken off the ventilator and clearly will not be able to breathe for himself much longer. Earlier in the day the nurse mentioned something about an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain waves in the cerebral hemispheres, the parts of the brain that deal with speech and memory. But his brain stem is damaged; it seems now the test will not be necessary. The son expects an almost silent, hollow gasp to come from the old man’s open mouth. Those final sounds, however, are nothing like the wind moving through the vacancy of a mind. The release is jerky and convulsive. There is never the rasp or the choke the son expects, though one meaning of worry is to be choked on, to choke on.

after so many years of only that,
after thinking that nothing else mattered.
And what was I thinking of when I stopped
thinking about Love? Death, of course—what else
could take Love’s place? What else could hold such force?
I thought about how far away Death once
had seemed, how unexpected that it could
happen to someone I knew quite well,
how impossible that this should be the
normal thing, as natural as frost and
winter. I thought about the way we’d aged,

will be clean again in twenty years. I imagine nets
burdened with rough shells, the meat dun and sexual.
Below, the river and the high rock
where boys each year jump from bravado

And innocently, sideways, the way we always fall
into grace or knowledge, we watched the police
drag the river for a suicide, the third this year.

His face was blank and new as your face
in the morning before the day has worked
its pattern of lines and tensions. A hook
like an iron question and this coming
out of the waters, a flawed pearl—
a memory that wasn’t ours to claim.   
Perhaps, in a bedroom by lamplight,   
a woman waits for this boy. She may riffle drawers
gathering photographs, string, keys to abandoned rooms.
Even now she may be leaving,   
closing the door for some silence. I need
to move next to you. Water sluiced
from the boy’s hair. I need to watch you
light your cigarette, the flickering
of your face in matchlight, as if underwater,
drifting away. I take your cigarette

Remember that winter of your long fever,   
the winter we understood how fragile
any being together was. The wall sweated   
behind the headboard and you said you felt
the rim where dreams crouch
and every room of the past. It must begin in luxury—
do you think—a break and fall into the glamour
attending each kind of surrender. Water must flood
the mind, as in certain diseases, the walls
between the cells of memory dissolve, blur
into a single stream of voices and faces.   
I don’t know any more about this river or if
it can be cleaned of its tender and broken histories—

I So you have swept me back, I who could have walked with the live souls above the earth, I who could have slept among the live flowers at last; so for your arrogance and your ruthlessness I am swept back where dead lichens drip dead cinders upon moss of ash; so for your arrogance I am broken at last, I who had lived unconscious, who was almost forgot; if you had let me wait I had grown from listlessness into peace, if you had let me rest with the dead, I had forgot you and the past.                                II Here only flame upon flame and black among the red sparks, streaks of black and light grown colourless; why did you turn back, that hell should be reinhabited of myself thus swept into nothingness? why did you glance back? why did you hesitate for that moment? why did you bend your face caught with the flame of the upper earth, above my face? what was it that crossed my face with the light from yours and your glance? what was it you saw in my face? the light of your own face, the fire of your own presence? What had my face to offer but reflex of the earth, hyacinth colour caught from the raw fissure in the rock where the light struck, and the colour of azure crocuses and the bright surface of gold crocuses and of the wind-flower, swift in its veins as lightning and as white.                                III Saffron from the fringe of the earth, wild saffron that has bent over the sharp edge of earth, all the flowers that cut through the earth, all, all the flowers are lost; everything is lost, everything is crossed with black, black upon black and worse than black, this colourless light.                                IV Fringe upon fringe of blue crocuses, crocuses, walled against blue of themselves, blue of that upper earth, blue of the depth upon depth of flowers, lost; flowers, if I could have taken once my breath of them, enough of them, more than earth, even than of the upper earth, had passed with me beneath the earth; if I could have caught up from the earth, the whole of the flowers of the earth, if once I could have breathed into myself the very golden crocuses and the red, and the very golden hearts of the first saffron, the whole of the golden mass, the whole of the great fragrance, I could have dared the loss.                               V So for your arrogance and your ruthlessness I have lost the earth   and the flowers of the earth, and the live souls above the earth, and you who passed across the light and reached ruthless; you who have your own light, who are to yourself a presence, who need no presence; yet for all your arrogance and your glance, I tell you this: such loss is no loss, such terror, such coils and strands and pitfalls of blackness, such terror is no loss; hell is no worse than your earth above the earth, hell is no worse, no, nor your flowers nor your veins of light nor your presence, a loss; my hell is no worse than yours though you pass among the flowers and speak with the spirits above earth.                                VI Against the black I have more fervour than you in all the splendour of that place, against the blackness and the stark grey I have more light; and the flowers, if I should tell you, you would turn from your own fit paths toward hell, turn again and glance back and I would sink into a place even more terrible than this.                               VII At least I have the flowers of myself, and my thoughts, no god can take that; I have the fervour of myself for a presence and my own spirit for light; and my spirit with its loss knows this; though small against the black, small against the formless rocks, hell must break before I am lost; before I am lost, hell must open like a red rose for the dead to pass.

The wild sea moaned, the black clouds spread Moving shadows on its bed, But one of us lay midship dead. I saw his coffin sliding down The yellow sand in yonder town, Where I put on my sorrow’s crown. And we returned; in this drear place Never to see him face to face, I thrust aside the living race. Mothers, who mourn with me today, Oh, understand me, when I say, I cannot weep, I cannot pray; I gaze upon a hidden store, His books, his toys, the clothes he wore, And cry, ‘Once more, to me, once more!’ Then take, from me, this simple verse, That you may know what I rehearse— A grief – your and my Universe!

I saw him rise o’er the forest trees; I saw his pinion ride the breeze; Beyond the clouds I watched him tower On his path of pride – his flight of power. I watched him wheeling, stern and lone, Where the keenest ray of the sun was thrown; Soaring, circling – bathed in light: Such was that desert eagle’s flight. Suddenly, then, to my straining eye, I saw the strong wing slack on high; Falling, falling to earth once more; The dark breast covered with foam and gore; The dark eyes’ glory dim with pain; Sick to death with a sun-struck brain! Reeling down from that height divine, Eagle of heaven! such fall was thine! Even so we see the sons of light, Up to the day-beam steer their flight; And the wing of genius cleaves the sky, As the clouds rush on when the winds are high: Then comes the hour of sudden dread—  Then is the blasting sunlight shed; And the gifted fall in their agony, Sund-struck eagle! to die like thee!

half-cars strewn, it was still, and bright,
a woman was lying on the highway, on her back,
with her head curled back and tucked under her shoulders

neutral twilight, broken glass

The last time I saw father alive he was using
a black umbrella, closed, to beat off some pigeons
hanging outside the marble portals of a museum.
We were visitors, walking very slowly, so father
could stoop and examine everything. We had not been
in the museum, but were resting on its steps.
We saw it all—the fountains, the statues, the parks
and the post office. Cities are made of such things.
Once we encountered a wedding coming out of the cathedral
and were caught in a shower of rice; as the bride
flicked her veiled head father licked his little finger
and in this way saved a grain. On the next block
he announced he was going to heaven. But first let’s
go back to the hotel and rest, he said: I want my mint.
Those were practically his last words. And what did I want
more than anything in the world? Probably the ancient Polish
recipe for blood soup, which was finally told to me
in an empty deli in a deserted mill town in western Massachusetts
by the owner’s mother, who was alone one day when I burst
in and demanded a bowl. But, she said, lacing her fingers
around a jar of morello cherries, it requires one cup of
new blood drawn from the goose whose neck you’ve just wrung
to put in the pot, and where in these days can I find
anything as fresh as that? I had lost track of my life
before, but nothing prepared me for the onslaught of
wayfarer’s bliss when she continued to list, one
by one, the impossible ingredients I needed to live.

snow fell on the locked doors of the church next door,

beautiful inside, and contain the remains of his beloved head.

I step into my mother’s room, she says, and though a woman’s body is a calendar of births and injunctions to death, time disappears. Only dead enough to bury could prove sound to silence or the anxiety I know by heart and lung. In my mother’s room. The tie between us anticipates any move to sever it. Terror and lack of perspective. The river runs clear without imparting its clarity, whether we step into it or not.
Deep in the bones, he says. If a butterfly fluttering its wings in China can cause a storm in Rhode Island, how much more the residues of radiation, family resemblance and past rituals. The stove glows red. Thin apple trees line the road. You think you are taking a clean sheet of paper, and it’s already covered with signs, illegible, as by child’s hand.
 
The heart has its rhythm of exchange, she says, without surplus or deficit. Mine murmurs your name while conjugating precise explosions with valves onto the infinite. I take it down with me, in the body, to develop in a darkroom of my own. They way the current elongates our reflection in the river and seems to carry it off.

Why don’t I respond when I’m being offended?
Because my religion doesn’t allow me to.
Exterior maps: geography. Interior maps: psychography.
And in your hard cathedral I kneel.
Mountains pass camels pass
like the history of wars in antiquity.
Of all the men I am, I can’t find any of them

Problems. Mysteries that fasten themselves to my chest.
All I want is not to see businesses nor gardens
nor markets nor eyeglasses nor elevators.

without discriminating between social classes, I speak a tongue
that fills hearts with the law of communicating clouds.

Her daughter wrote back to say my friend had died                      (my friend to whom I wrote a letter maybe twice a year). From time to time I'd pictured her amid strange foliage                      (and in a Mongol yurt, for she was fond of travel). Why not a flock of something darkening the sky, so we would know                      (ah, so-and-so is gone!)? For a woman from the city, this might perhaps be pigeons                      (blacking out the sun). Or else a human messenger, as once when she was fabric shopping                       (bolt of green silk furled across her body) Garbo passed, and nodded. At Macy's years ago                       (when I was not a creature in her world). Of course she bought the cloth, but never sewed the dress                      (""a massive stroke, and I take comfort in the fact                            she felt no pain."") Logic says we should make omens of our Garbos and our birds                      (but which one bears the message? which one just the mess?)  From the kayak, I've seen pigeons nesting underneath the pier                      (a dim ammoniated stink) where one flew into my face. I read this as a sign                       (that rancid smash of feathers) but couldn't fathom what it meant, trapped in the lag-time                      (of an oracle's translation). Foolish mind, wanting to obliterate the lag and why—                      (let memory wait to catch up to its sorrow).

Tell the grass, though it's already guessed, and the ground clenched in furrows; tell the water you spill on the ground, then all the water will know.

Krakatau split with a blinding noise and raised from gutted, steaming rock a pulverized black sky, over water walls that swiftly fell on Java and Sumatra. Fifteen days before, in its cage in Amsterdam, the last known member of Equus quagga, the southernmost subspecies of zebra, died. Most of the wild ones, not wild enough, grazing near the Cape of Good Hope, had been shot and skinned and roasted by white hunters. When a spider walked on cooling Krakatau's skin, no quagga walked anywhere. While seeds pitched by long winds onto newborn fields burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle flourished on the quagga's discarded innards. The fractured island greened and hummed again; handsome zebras tossed their heads in zoos, on hired safari plains. Who needs to hear a quagga's voice? Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly, see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs? A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo. Still, we mourn what we mourn. Even if, when it sank to its irreplaceable knees, when its unique throat closed behind a sigh, no dust rose to redden a whole year's sunsets, no one unwittingly busy two thousand miles away jumped at the sound, no ashes rained on ships in the merciless sea.

For the sun sifts through the shade.
Underneath the fallen blossom
In my bosom,
Is a letter I have hid.
It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.
“Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell
Died in action Thursday sen’night.”
As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,
The letters squirmed like snakes.
“Any answer, Madam,” said my footman.
“No,” l told him.
“See that the messenger takes some refreshment.
No, no answer.”
And I walked into the garden,
Up and down the patterned paths,
In my stiff, correct brocade.
The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,
Each one.
I stood upright too,
Held rigid to the pattern
By the stiffness of my gown.
Up and down I walked,
Up and down.
In a month he would have been my husband.
In a month, here, underneath this lime,
We would have broke the pattern;
He for me, and I for him,
He as Colonel, I as Lady,
On this shady seat.
He had a whim
That sunlight carried blessing.
And I answered, “It shall be as you have said.”
Now he is dead.
In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
Up and down
The patterned garden paths
In my stiff, brocaded gown.
The squills and daffodils
Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.
I shall go
Up and down,
In my gown.
Gorgeously arrayed,
Boned and stayed.
And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace
By each button, hook, and lace.
For the man who should loose me is dead,
Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,
In a pattern called a war.
Christ! What are patterns for?

As I sit here in the quiet Summer night,
Suddenly, from the distant road, there comes
The grind and rush of an electric car.
And, from still farther off,
An engine puffs sharply,
Followed by the drawn-out shunting scrape of a freight train.
These are the sounds that men make
In the long business of living.
They will always make such sounds,
Years after I am dead and cannot hear them.
Sitting here in the Summer night,
I think of my death.
What will it be like for you then?
You will see my chair
With its bright chintz covering
Standing in the afternoon sunshine,
As now.
You will see my narrow table
At which I have written so many hours.
My dogs will push their noses into your hand,
And ask—ask—
Clinging to you with puzzled eyes.
The old house will still be here,
The old house which has known me since the beginning.
The walls which have watched me while I played:
Soldiers, marbles, paper-dolls,
Which have protected me and my books.
The front-door will gaze down among the old trees
Where, as a child, I hunted ghosts and Indians;
It will look out on the wide gravel sweep
Where I rolled my hoop,
And at the rhododendron bushes
Where I caught black-spotted butterflies.
The old house will guard you,
As I have done.
Its walls and rooms will hold you,
And I shall whisper my thoughts and fancies
As always,
From the pages of my books.
You will sit here, some quiet Summer night,
Listening to the puffing trains,
But you will not be lonely,
For these things are a part of me.
And my love will go on speaking to you
Through the chairs, and the tables, and the pictures,
As it does now through my voice,
And the quick, necessary touch of my hand.

I was living in San Francisco  My heart was in Manhattan It made no sense, no reference point  Hearing the sad horns at night,  fragile evocations of female stuff  The 3 tones (the last most resonant) were like warnings, haiku-muezzins at dawn The call came in the afternoon  “Frank, is that really you?” I'd awake chilled at dawn in the wooden house like an old ship  Stay bundled through the day sitting on the stoop to catch the sun I lived near the park whose deep green  over my shoulder made life cooler  Was my spirit faltering, grown duller? I want to be free of poetry's ornaments,  its duty, free of constant irritation,  me in it, what was grander reason  for being? Do it, why? (Why, Frank?)  To make the energies dance etc. My coat a cape of horrors I'd walk through town or impending earthquake. Was that it?  Ominous days. Street shiny with  hallucinatory light on sad dogs, too many religious people, or a woman  startled me by her look of indecision  near the empty stadium I walked back spooked by my own darkness Then Frank called to say “What? Not done complaining yet?  Can't you smell the eucalyptus, have you never neared the Pacific?  ‘While frank and free/call for musick while your veins swell’”  he sang, quoting a metaphysician  ""Don't you know the secret, how to  wake up and see you don't exist, but  that does, don't you see phenomena  is so much more important than this?  I always love that.” “Always?” I cried, wanting to believe him  “Yes.” “But say more! How can you if  it's sad & dead?” “But that's just it!  If! It isn't. It doesn't want to be Do you want to be?” He was warming to his song  “Of course I don't have to put up with as  much as you do these days. These years.  But I do miss the color, the architecture,  the talk. You know, it was the life!  And dying is such an insult. After all  I was in love with breath and I loved  embracing those others, the lovers,  with my body.” He sighed & laughed  He wasn't quite as I'd remembered him  Not less generous, but more abstract  Did he even have a voice now, I wondered  or did I think it up in the middle  of this long day, phone in hand now  dialing Manhattan

  And good at my art, for a woman, men said ;But this woman, this, who is agonized here,
  — The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head
     For ever instead.III. What art can a woman be good at ? Oh, vain !
  What art is she good at, but hurting her breastWith the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain ?
  Ah boys, how you hurt ! you were strong as you pressed,
     And I proud, by that test.IV. What art's for a woman ? To hold on her knees
  Both darlings ! to feel all their arms round her throat,Cling, strangle a little ! to sew by degrees
  And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat ;
     To dream and to doat.V. To teach them ... It stings there ! I made them indeed
  Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no doubt,That a country's a thing men should die for at need.I prated of liberty, rights, and about
     The tyrant cast out.VI. And when their eyes flashed ... O my beautiful eyes ! ...I exulted ; nay, let them go forth at the wheelsOf the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise
  When one sits quite alone ! Then one weeps, then one kneels !
     God, how the house feels !VII. At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled
  With my kisses, — of camp-life and glory, and howThey both loved me ; and, soon coming home to be spoiled
  In return would fan off every fly from my brow
     With their green laurel-bough.VIII. Then was triumph at Turin : Ancona was free !'
  And some one came out of the cheers in the street,With a face pale as stone, to say something to me.
  My Guido was dead ! I fell down at his feet,
     While they cheered in the street.IX. I bore it ; friends soothed me ; my grief looked sublime
  As the ransom of Italy. One boy remainedTo be leant on and walked with, recalling the time
  When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained
     To the height he had gained.X. And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong,
  Writ now but in one hand, I was not to faint, —One loved me for two — would be with me ere long :
  And Viva l' Italia ! — he died for, our saint,
     Who forbids our complaint.""XI. My Nanni would add, he was safe, and aware
  Of a presence that turned off the balls, — was imprestIt was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,
  And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed,
     To live on for the rest.""XII. On which, without pause, up the telegraph line
  Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta : — Shot.Tell his mother. Ah, ah,  his, '  their ' mother, — not  mine, '
  No voice says ""My mother"" again to me. What !
     You think Guido forgot ?XIII. Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,
  They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe ?I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven
  Through THAT Love and Sorrow which reconciled so
     The Above and Below.XIV. O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the dark
  To the face of Thy mother ! consider, I pray,How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,
  Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away,
     And no last word to say !XV. Both boys dead ? but that's out of nature. We all
  Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one.'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall ;
  And, when Italy 's made, for what end is it done
     If we have not a son ?XVI. Ah, ah, ah ! when Gaeta's taken, what then ?
  When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sportOf the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men ?
  When the guns of Cavalli with final retort
     Have cut the game short ?XVII. When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,
  When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red,When you have your country from mountain to sea,
  When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,
     (And I have my Dead) —XVIII. What then ? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low,
  And burn your lights faintly ! My country is there,Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow :
  My Italy 's THERE, with my brave civic Pair,
     To disfranchise despair !XIX. Forgive me. Some women bear children in strength,
  And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn ;But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length
  Into wail such as this — and we sit on forlorn
     When the man-child is born.XX. Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east,
  And one of them shot in the west by the sea.Both ! both my boys ! If in keeping the feast
  You want a great song for your Italy free,

At the accustomed wordsI gave my hand, the old position took.Sound, gladsome measure! at whose bidding onceI felt the flush of pleasure to my brow,While my soul shook the burthen of the flesh,And in its young pride said, Lie lightly thou!'Then, like a gallant swimmer, flinging highMy breast against the golden waves of sound,I rode the madd'ning tumult of the dance,Mocking fatigue, that never could be found.Chide not,—it was not vanity, nor sense,(The brutish scorn such vaporous delight,)But Nature, cadencing her joy of strengthTo the harmonious limits of her right.She gave her impulse to the dancing Hours,To winds that sweep, to stars that noiseless turn;She marked the measure rapid hearts must keepDevised each pace that glancing feet should learn.And sure, that prodigal o'erflow of life,Unvow'd as yet to family or state,Sweet sounds, white garments, flowery coronalsMake holy, in the pageant of our fate.Sound, measure! but to stir my heart no more—For, as I moved to join the dizzy race,My youth fell from me; all its blooms were gone,And others showed them, smiling, in my face.Faintly I met the shock of circling formsLinked each to other, Fashion's galley-slaves,Dream-wondering, like an unaccustomed ghostThat starts, surprised, to stumble over graves.For graves were 'neath my feet, whose placid masksSmiled out upon my folly mournfully,While all the host of the departed said,Tread lightly—thou art ashes, even as we.'

On Death's domain intent I fix my eyes,Where human nature in vast ruin lies,With pensive mind I search the drear abode,Where the great conqu'ror has his spoils bestow'd;There there the offspring of six thousand yearsIn endless numbers to my view appears:Whole kingdoms in his gloomy den are thrust,And nations mix with their primeval dust:Insatiate still he gluts the ample tomb;His is the present, his the age to comeSee here a brother, here a sister spread,And a sweet daughter mingled with the dead.But, Madam, let your grief be laid aside,And let the fountain of your tears be dry'd,In vain they flow to wet the dusty plain,Your sighs are wafted to the skies in vain,Your pains they witness, but they can no more,While Death reigns tyrant o'er this mortal shore.The glowing stars and silver queen of lightAt last must perish in the gloom of night:Resign thy friends to that Almighty hand,Which gave them life, and bow to his command;Thine Avis give without a murm'ring heart,Though half thy soul be fated to depart.To shining guards consign thine infant careTo waft triumphant through the seas of air:Her soul enlarg'd to heav'nly pleasure springs,She feeds on truth and uncreated things.Methinks I hear her in the realms above,And leaning forward with a filial love,Invite you there to share immortal blissUnknown, untasted in a state like this.With tow'ring hopes, and growing grace arise,And seek beatitude beyond the skies.

How can you lie so still? All day I watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so weary in my ears: ""Lie still And rest; be patient and lie still and rest."" I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held. Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammeled down the flaming noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on rebellion's end; ""Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now As dead and quiet as the others are."" And this each body and ghost of you hath heard That in your graves do therefore lie so still.

There will be no right hand. And the figure of sorrow and grace, with his staff upright, its purple pennant caught in that final wind, will not be there to greet us, with the mercy of justice in his eyes. No, never judgment. Just the abyss into which all acts are thrown down, and the terrible white silence in which judgment either endures or burns.

                    Finding My Mother
                ","
Near dusk I find her in a newly mown field, lying still
and face down in the coarse stubble. Her arms
 
are splayed out on either side of her body, palms open
and turned upward like two lilies, the slender fingers
 
gently curling, as if holding onto something. Her legs
are drawn up underneath her, as if she fell asleep there
 
on her knees, perhaps while praying, perhaps intoxicated
by the sweet liquid odor of sheared grass.
 
Her small ankles, white and unscarred, are crossed
one on top of the other, as if arranged so in ritual fashion.
 
Her feet are bare. I cannot see her face, turned
toward the ground as it is,
 
but her long black hair is lovelier than I remember it,
spilling across her back and down onto the felled stalks
 
like a pour of glossy tar. Her flesh is smooth
and cool, slightly resistant to my touch.
 
I begin to look around me for something with which
to carry her back—carry her back, I hear myself say,
 
as if the words spoken aloud, even in a dream,
will somehow make it possible.
 
I am alone in a field, at dusk, the light leaving
the way it has to, leaking away the way it has to
 
behind a ridge of swiftly blackening hills. I lie down
on the ground beside my mother under falling darkness
 
and draw my coat over our bodies. We sleep there like that.

I saw you fall to the ground.
I saw the oaks fall.  The clouds collapsed.
I saw a wildness twist through your limbs
and fly off.  The river fell, the grasses fell. 
The backs of six drowned cattle
rose to the surface ice—nothing moved.
But a wind touched my ankles when the snow began.
You left that night and we stayed,
our arms braced with weight.  What power
there was was over.  But I switched on the light
by the porch to see if anything was falling—
and it fell, a few glints in the air,
catching sun although there was no sun,
and the long descent over hours, all night,
seemed like years, and we buried our faces
in what came to rest on the ground
or moved our feet over it, effortless,
as nothing was in our lives, or ever will be.

Is it you on the other end of the line
     hesitant to speak to me, pausing for a moment
to register my hello so you know my number
     stayed the same, my last name remains mine?
Though my voice isn’t young as when we last spoke,
     don’t you hear a familiar timbre?
Still you hesitate so as not to startle me
     after all this time. Dots string out like an ellipsis
in the endless sentence of your absence.
     I hear static-filled ticking, then
a friendly stranger mispronounces my name.
     Recognizing a pitch to sell something
and feeling foolish, I hang up quickly.
     Won’t you ever break your long silence?
Sorrow and anger keep my line open to you.

We set up an assembly line.
I heat the tortillas in manteca 
after Crystal dips them in chile ancho 
and drains them. Niles carries full plates
of hot tortillas to his father,
who rolls them around spoonfuls of filling.
When we’ve finished the hot, greasy work,
I pour the last of the sauce over neat rows
of stuffed tortillas, sprinkle them with cheese,
clean the stove and counters.
The kids help their father rinse plates and pans.
They don’t know this is the last time.
The cheese melts. Crystal
dances to “No More Lonely Nights” on the radio.
Niles and his dad joke and wrestle.
After grace, we sit before steaming plates.
The kids stuff their mouths, insult each other,
and laugh. We can’t avoid their eyes
forever. Their father and I stare
at each other across the table.

Now you are strong
And we are but grapes aching with ripeness.
Crush us!
Squeeze from us all the brave life
Contained in these full skins.
But ours is a subtle strength

Of being kegged and shut away
In dark forgotten places.

Since you would claim the sources of my thoughtRecall the meshes whence it sprang unlimed,The reedy traps which other hands have timedTo close upon it. Conjure up the hotBlaze that it cleared so cleanly, or the snowDevised to strike it down. It will be free.Whatever nets draw in to prison meAt length your eyes must turn to watch it go.
 My mouth, perhaps, may learn one thing too well,My body hear no echo save its own,Yet will the desperate mind, maddened and proud,Seek out the storm, escape the bitter spellThat we obey, strain to the wind, be thrownStraight to its freedom in the thunderous cloud.

Orphan in my first years, I early learnt
To make my heart suffice itself, and seek
Support and sympathy in its own depths.
 




Well, read my cheek, and watch my eye, —
    Too strictly school'd are they
One secret of my soul to show,
    One hidden thought betray.
 
I never knew the time my heart
    Look'd freely from my brow;
It once was check'd by timidness,
     'Tis taught by caution now.
 
I live among the cold, the false,
    And I must seem like them;
And such I am, for I am false
   As those I most condemn.
 
I teach my lip its sweetest smile,
    My tongue its softest tone;
I borrow others' likeness, till
    Almost I lose my own.
 
I pass through flattery's gilded sieve,
    Whatever I would say;
In social life, all, like the blind,
    Must learn to feel their way.
 
I check my thoughts like curbed steeds
    That struggle with the rein;
I bid my feelings sleep, like wrecks
    In the unfathom'd main.
 
I hear them speak of love, the deep.
    The true, and mock the name;
Mock at all high and early truth,
    And I too do the same.
 
I hear them tell some touching tale,
    I swallow down the tear;
I hear them name some generous deed,
    And I have learnt to sneer.
 
I hear the spiritual, the kind,
    The pure, but named in mirth;
Till all of good, ay, even hope,
    Seems exiled from our earth.
 
And one fear, withering ridicule,
    Is all that I can dread;
A sword hung by a single hair
    For ever o'er the head.
 
We bow to a most servile faith,
    In a most servile fear;
While none among us dares to say
    What none will choose to hear.
 
And if we dream of loftier thoughts,
    In weakness they are gone;
And indolence and vanity
    Rivet our fetters on.
 
Surely I was not born for this!
    I feel a loftier mood
Of generous impulse, high resolve,
    Steal o'er my solitude!
 
I gaze upon the thousand stars
    That fill the midnight sky;
And wish, so passionately wish,
    A light like theirs on high.
 
I have such eagerness of hope
    To benefit my kind;
And feel as if immortal power
    Were given to my mind.
 
I think on that eternal fame,
    The sun of earthly gloom.
Which makes the gloriousness of death,
    The future of the tomb —
 
That earthly future, the faint sign
    Of a more heavenly one;
— A step, a word, a voice, a look, —
    Alas! my dream is done!
 
And earth, and earth's debasing stain,
    Again is on my soul;
And I am but a nameless part
    Of a most worthless whole.
 
Why write I this? because my heart
    Towards the future springs,
That future where it loves to soar
    On more than eagle wings.
 
The present, it is but a speck
    In that eternal time,
In which my lost hopes find a home,
    My spirit knows its clime.
 
Oh! not myself, — for what am I? —
    The worthless and the weak,
Whose every thought of self should raise
    A blush to burn my cheek.
 
But song has touch’d my lips with fire.
    And made my heart a shrine;
For what, although alloy'd, debased,
    Is in itself divine.
 
I am myself but a vile link
    Amid life's weary chain;
But I have spoken hallow'd words,
    O do not say in vain!
 
My first, my last, my only wish,
    Say will my charmed chords
Wake to the morning light of fame,
    And breathe again my words?
 
Will the young maiden, when her tears
    Alone in moonlight shine —
Tears for the absent and the loved —
    Murmur some song of mine?
 
Will the pale youth by his dim lamp,
    Himself a dying flame,
From many an antique scroll beside,
    Choose that which bears my name?
 
Let music make less terrible
    The silence of the dead;
I care not, so my spirit last
    Long after life has fled.

Was she of spirit race, or was she one
Of earth's least earthly daughters, one to whom
A gift of loveliness and soul is given,
Only to make them wretched?

There is an antique gem, on which her brow
Retains its graven beauty even now.
Her hair is braided, but one curl behind
Floats as enamour'd of the summer wind;
The rest is simple. Is she not too fair
Even to think of maiden's sweetest care?
The mouth and brow are contrasts. One so fraught
With pride, the melancholy pride of thought
Conscious of power, and yet forced to know
How little way such power as that can go;
Regretting, while too proud of the fine mind,
Which raises but to part it from its kind:
But the sweet mouth had nothing of all this;
It was a mouth the rose had lean'd to kiss
For her young sister, telling, now though mute,
How soft an echo it was to the lute.
The one spoke genius, in its high revealing;
The other smiled a woman's gentle feeling.
It was a lovely face: the Greek outline
Flowing, yet delicate and feminine;
The glorious lightning of the kindled eye,
Raised, as it communed with its native sky.
A lovely face the spirit's fitting shrine;
The one almost, the other quite divine.




My hand is on the lyre which never more
With its sweet commerce, like a bosom friend,
Will share the deeper thoughts which I could trust
Only to music and to solitude.
It is the very grove, the olive grove,
Where first I laid my laurel crown aside,
And bathed my fever'd brow in the cold stream;
As if that I could wash away the fire
Which from that moment kindled in my heart.
I well remember how I flung myself,
Like a young goddess, on a purple cloud
Of light and odour — the rich violets
Were so ethereal in bloom and breath:
And I — I felt immortal, for my brain
Was drunk and mad with its first draught of fame.
'Tis strange there was one only cypress tree,
And then, as now, I lay beneath its shade.
The night had seen me pace my lonely room,
Clasping the lyre I had no heart to wake,
Impatient for the day: yet its first dawn
Came cold as death; for every pulse sank down,
Until the very presence of my hope
Became to me a fear.    The sun rose up;
I stood alone 'mid thousands: but I felt
Mine inspiration; and, as the last sweep
Of my song died away amid the hills,
My heart reverb'rated the shout which bore
To the blue mountains and the distant heavenErinna's name, and on my bended knee,
Olympus, I received thy laurel crown.
 
   And twice new birth of violets have sprung,
Since they were first my pillow, since I sought
In the deep silence of the olive grove
The dreamy happiness which solitude
Brings to the soul o'erfill'd with its delight:
For I was like some young and sudden heir
Of a rich palace heap'd with gems and gold,
Whose pleasure doubles as he sums his wealth
And forms a thousand plans of festival;
Such were my myriad visions of delight.
The lute, which hitherto in Delphian shades
Had been my twilight's solitary joy,
Would henceforth be a sweet and breathing bond
Between me and my kind.    Orphan unloved,
I had been lonely from my childhood's hour,
Childhood whose very happiness is love:
But that was over now; my lyre would be
My own heart's true interpreter, and those
To whom my song was dear, would they not bless
The hand that waken'd it? I should be loved
For the so gentle sake of those soft chords
Which mingled others' feelings with mine own.
 
    Vow'd I that song to meek and gentle thoughts,
To tales that told of sorrow and of love,
To all our nature's finest touches, all
That wakens sympathy: and I should be
Alone no longer; every wind that bore,
And every lip that breathed one strain of mine,
Henceforth partake in all my joy and grief.
Oh! glorious is the gifted poet's lot,
And touching more than glorious: 'tis to be
Companion of the heart's least earthly hour;
The voice of love and sadness, calling forth
Tears from their silent fountain: 'tis to have
Share in all nature's loveliness; giving flowers
A life as sweet, more lasting than their own;
And catching from green wood and lofty pine
Language mysterious as musical;
Making the thoughts, which else had only been
Like colours on the morning's earliest hour,
Immortal, and worth immortality;
Yielding the hero that eternal name
For which he fought; making the patriot's deed
A stirring record for long after-time;
Cherishing tender thoughts, which else had pass'd
Away like tears; and saving the loved dead
From death's worst part — its deep forgetfulness.
 
From the first moment when a falling leaf,
Or opening bud, or streak of rose-touch'd sky,
Waken'd in me the flush and flow of song,
I gave my soul entire unto the gift
I deem'd mine own, direct from heaven; it was
The hope, the bliss, the energy of life;
I had no hope that dwelt not with my lyre,
No bliss whose being grew not from my lyre,
No energy undevoted to my lyre.
It was my other self that had a power;
Mine, but o'er which I had not a control.
At times it was not with me, and I felt
A wonder how it ever had been mine:
And then a word, a look of loveliness,
A tone of music, call'd it into life;
A song came gushing, like the natural tears,
To check whose current does not rest with us.
 
    Had I lived ever in the savage woods,
Or in some distant island, which the sea
With wind and wave guards in deep loneliness;
Had my eye never on the beauty dwelt
Of human face, and my ear never drank
The music of a human voice; I feel
My spirit would have pour'd itself in song,
Have learn'd a language from the rustling leaves,
The singing of the birds, and of the tide.
Perchance, then, happy had I never known
Another thought could be attach'd to song
Than of its own delight.    Oh! let me pause
Over this earlier period, when my heart
Mingled its being with its pleasures, fill'd
With rich enthusiasm, which once flung
Its purple colouring o'er all things of earth,
And without which our utmost power of thought
But sharpens arrows that will drink our blood.
Like woman's soothing influence o'er man
Enthusiasm is upon the mind;
Softening and beautifying that which is
Too harsh and sullen in itself.    How much
I loved the painter's glorious art, which forms
A world like, but more beautiful than, this;
Just catching nature in her happiest mood!
How drank I in fine poetry, which makes
The hearing passionate, fill'd with memories
Which steal from out the past like rays from clouds!
And then the sweet songs of my native vale,
Whose sweetness and whose softness call'd to mind
The perfume of the flowers, the purity
Of the blue sky; oh, how they stirr'd my soul! —
Amid the many golden gifts which heaven
Has left, like portions of its light, on earth
None hath such influence as music hath.
The painter's hues stand visible before us
In power and beauty; we can trace the thoughts
Which are the workings of the poet's mind:
But music is a mystery, and viewless
Even when present, and is less man's act,
And less within his order; for the hand
That can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell
Whither they go, or if they live or die,
When floated once beyond his feeble ear;
And then, as if it were an unreal thing,
The wind will sweep from the neglected strings
As rich a swell as ever minstrel drew.
 
    A poet's word, a painter's touch, will reach
The innermost recesses of the heart,
Making the pulses throb in unison
With joy or grief, which we can analyse;
There is the cause for pleasure and for pain:
But music moves us, and we know not why;
We feel the tears, but cannot trace their source.
Is it the language of some other state,
Born of its memory?    For what can wake
The soul's strong instinct of another world,
Like music?    Well with sadness doth it suit
To hear the melancholy sounds decay,
And think (for thoughts are life's great human links,
And mingle with our feelings) even so
Will the heart's wildest pulses sink to rest.
 
    How have I loved, when the red evening fill'd
Our temple with its glory, first, to gaze
On the strange contrast of the crimson air,
Lighted as if with passion, and flung back,
From silver vase and tripod rich with gems,
To the pale statues round, where human life
Was not, but beauty was, which seem'd to have
Apart existence from humanity:
Then, to go forth where the tall waving pines
Seem'd as behind them roll'd a golden sea
Immortal and eternal; and the boughs,
That darkly swept between me and its light,
Were fitting emblems of the worldly cares
That are the boundary between us and heaven;
Meanwhile, the wind, a wilful messenger
Lingering amid the flowers on his way,
At intervals swept past in melody,
The lutes and voices of the choral hymn
Contending with the rose-breath on his wing!
Perhaps it is these pleasures' chiefest charm,
They are so indefinable, so vague.
From earliest childhood all too well aware
Of the uncertain nature of our joys,
It is delicious to enjoy, yet know
No after-consequence will be to weep.
Pride misers with enjoyment, when we have
Delight in things that are but of the mind:
But half humility when we partake
Pleasures that are half wants, the spirit pines
And struggles in its fetters, and disdains
The low base clay to which it is allied.
But here our rapture raises us: we feel
What glorious power is given to man, and find
Our nature's nobleness and attributes,
Whose heaven is intellect; and we are proud
To think how we can love those things of earth
Which are least earthly; and the soul grows pure
In this high communing, and more divine.
 
    This time of dreaming happiness pass'd by,
Another spirit was within my heart;
I drank the maddening cup of praise, which grew
Henceforth the fountain of my life; I lived
Only in others' breath; a word, a look,
Were of all influence on my destiny:
If praise they spoke, 'twas sunlight to my soul;
Or censure, it was like the scorpion's sting.
 
And yet a darker lesson was to learn —
The hollowness of each: that praise, which is
But base exchange of flattery; that blame,
Given by cautious coldness, which still deems
'Tis safest to depress; that mockery,
Flinging shafts but to show its own keen aim;
That carelessness, whose very censure's chance;
And, worst of all, the earthly judgment pass'd
By minds whose native clay is unredeem'd
By aught of heaven, whose every thought falls foul
Plague-spot on beauty which they cannot feel,
Tainting all that it touches with itself.
O dream of fame, what hast thou been to me
But the destroyer of life's calm content!
I feel so more than ever, that thy sway
Is weaken'd over me. Once I could find
A deep and dangerous delight in thee;
But that is gone.    I am too much awake.
Light has burst o'er me, but not morning's light;
'Tis such light as will burst upon the tomb,
When all but judgment's over.    Can it be,
That these fine impulses, these lofty thoughts,
Burning with their own beauty, are but given
To make me the low slave of vanity,
Heartless and humbled?     O my own sweet power,
Surely thy songs are made for more than this!
What a worst waste of feeling and of life
Have been the imprints of my roll of time,
Too much, too long!    To what use have I turn'd
The golden gifts in which I pride myself?
They are profaned; with their pure ore I made
A temple resting only on the breath
Of heedless worshippers.    Alas! that ever
Praise should have been what it has been to me —
The opiate of my heart.    Yet I have dream'd
Of things which cannot be; the bright, the pure,
That all of which the heart may only dream;
And I have mused upon my gift of song,
And deeply felt its beauty, and disdain'd
The pettiness of praise to which at times
My soul has bow'd; and I have scorn'd myself
For that my cheek could burn, my pulses beat
At idle words.    And yet it is in vain
For the full heart to press back every throb
Wholly upon itself.    Ay, fair as are
The visions of a poet's solitude,
There must be something more for happiness;
They seek communion.    It had seem'd to me
A miser's selfishness, had I not sought
To share with others those impassion'd thoughts,
Like light, or hope, or love, in their effects.
When I have watch'd the stars write on the sky
In characters of light, have seen the moon
Come like veiled priestess from the east,
While, like a hymn, the wind swell'd on mine ear,
Telling soft tidings of eve's thousand flowers,
Has it not been the transport of my lute
To find its best delight in sympathy?
Alas! the idols which our hopes set up,
They are Chaldean ones, half gold, half clay;
We trust we are deceived, we hope, we fear,
Alike without foundation; day by day
Some new illusion is destroyed, and life
Gets cold and colder on towards its close.
Just like the years which make it, some are check'd
By sudden blights in spring; some are dried up
By fiery summers; others waste away
In calm monotony of quiet skies,
And peradventure these may be the best:
They know no hurricanes, no floods that sweep
As a God's vengeance were upon each wave;
But then they have no ruby fruits, no flowers
Shining in purple, and no lighted mines
Of gold and diamond.    Which is the best, —
Beauty and glory, in a southern clime,
Mingled with thunder, tempest; or the calm
Of skies that scarcely change, which, at the least,
If much of shine they have not, have no storms?
I know not: but I know fair earth or sky
Are self-consuming in their loveliness,
And the too radiant sun and fertile soil
In their luxuriance run themselves to waste,
And the green valley and the silver stream
Become a sandy desert.    O! the mind,
Too vivid in its lighted energies,
May read its fate in sunny Araby.
How lives its beauty in each Eastern tale,
Its growth of spices, and its groves of balm!
They are exhausted; and what is it now?
A wild and burning wilderness.    Alas!
For such similitude. Too much this is
The fate of this world's loveliest and best.
 
    Is there not a far people, who possess
Mysterious oracles of olden time,
Who say that this earth labours with a curse,
That it is fallen from its first estate,
And is now but the shade of what it was?
I do believe the tale.    I feel its truth
In my vain aspirations, in the dreams
That are revealings of another world,
More pure, more perfect than our weary one,
Where day is darkness to the starry soul.
 
    O heart of mine! my once sweet paradise
Of love and hope! how changed thou art to me!
I cannot count thy changes: thou hast lost
Interest in the once idols of thy being;
They have departed, even as if wings
Had borne away their morning; they have left
Weariness, turning pleasure into pain,
And too sure knowledge of their hollowness.
 
    And that too is gone from me; that which was
My solitude's delight!    I can no more
Make real existence of a shadowy world.
Time was, the poet's song, the ancient tale,
Were to me fountains of deep happiness,
For they grew visible in my lonely hours,
As things in which I had a deed and part;
Their actual presence had not been more true:
But these are bubbling sparkles, that are found
But at the spring's first source.    Ah! years may bring
The mind to its perfection, but no more
Will those young visions live in their own light;
Life's troubles stir life's waters all too much,
Passions chase fancies, and though still we dream,
The colouring is from reality.
 
    Farewell, my lyre! thou hast not been to me
All I once hoped.    What is the gift of mind,
But as a barrier to so much that makes
Our life endurable, — companionship,
Mingling affection, calm and gentle peace,
Till the vex'd spirit seals with discontent
A league of sorrow and of vanity,
Built on a future which will never be!
 
    And yet I would resign the praise that now
Makes my cheek crimson, and my pulses beat,
Could I but deem that when my hand is cold,
And my lip passionless, my songs would be
Number'd mid the young poet's first delights;
Read by the dark-eyed maiden in an hour
Of moonlight, till her cheek shone with its tears;
And murmur'd by the lover when his suit
Calls upon poetry to breathe of love.
I do not hope a sunshine burst of fame,
My lyre asks but a wreath of fragile flowers.
I have told passionate tales of breaking hearts,
Of young cheeks fading even before the rose;
My songs have been the mournful history
Of woman's tenderness and woman's tears;
I have touch'd but the spirit's gentlest chords, —
Surely the fittest for my maiden hand; —
And in their truth my immortality.
 
    Thou lovely and lone star, whose silver light,
Like music o'er the waters, steals along
The soften'd atmosphere; pale star, to thee
I dedicate the lyre, whose influence
I would have sink upon the heart like thine.
 
    In such an hour as this, the bosom turns
Back to its early feelings; man forgets
His stern ambition and his worldly cares,
And woman loathes the petty vanities
That mar her nature's beauty; like the dew,
Shedding its sweetness o'er the sleeping flowers
Till all their morning freshness is revived,
Kindly affections, sad but yet sweet thoughts,
Melt the cold eyes, long, long unused to weep.
O lute of mine, that I shall wake no more!
Such tearful music, linger on thy strings,
Consecrate unto sorrow and to love;
Thy truth, thy tenderness, be all thy fame!

Therefore, no more recounting of dreams, a routine thing

being a bride, she is changing behind that white curtain
Leora
fifteen again experiencing
prematurely the pure suckling of a baby
fifteen with a virgin desire for pure suckling
something to do with jasmine

existing only without accident
It blooms while Leora sleeps
when she sleeps at night and it is also dark

colostrums: the earliest secretions, and then only milk

ps: pastiche, salmagundi when all dressed up
Leg and fin share custody
so young men sacrifice only below the belt
to please her
many wounded soldiers
her company
From now on storming the beaches
rocks already aftermath, the breaking of dozens of sphinxes
the taming of sandstone lions and griffins, gargoyles
Leora takes to breast anything capable of sucking
and being filled, no ban on leeches and vipers
that stick out like misplaced overdeveloped hairs
and while in position, her free hand
shaves the heads of Medusa’s children screaming
for more nursing
with her eyes closed, her free handy blade, sharpened

The liquids of history therefore tend to ferment; the beverages for walks down
memory lane therefore become pungent cheeses and wines, the odes
to bitterness and sweetness happen. This is also desirable. Taste depends
on how the glass tilts, how tongue curls.
What’s difficult
is maintaining gaps as gaps. A sustainable nothingness.
But something enters. Sustainable nothingness
looks like a niche.
Ghosts and spirits of what’s been lost. A young woman looks over her shoulder.
Close watching of what’s fading does not mean the change from substance to spirit
would be observed. On the tippy-tips of split tail fin looking over her shoulder
a long line for the nurse, exceptional business, nonstop nursing
and the milk won’t stop, years are at the end of the line.
Pull the plug on a nearby respirator (how on earth?)

the substance travels the line
joins the community of electricity, colonies of gigantic storms
on the sun
and appearances in auroras
that the mermaid sits under as under any canopy
nonstop
The spell of the tide tailored to make the one falling under its influence fall more
willingly. It feels nothing like falling at all: Leora describes rehabilitation
Sand sparkles remembering having been alive
only once
Leora’s eyes
sparkle upon contact with crabs and their incredible redness
that ought to teach her something about fire she does not know
with top-heavy ways
of knowing
      (the brain should travel the stations of the body, and one day
       the eyes and navel, when the eyes accompany the brain,
       line up in a row)
                               —then a real reason for revisionDream on 
Accordingly, pureness of the situation milks its own purity
Fantastic and looks disgusting
        (no matter where the eyes are—candidate
         for truth)
but purity is still pure following
such a milking
The mermaid’s pregnancy has to be called immaculate after repeated searches for the
limits. Lost without those. Pure. Last resort and best explanation for birth of a human
baby from a mermaid without a human pelvis or womb. The best xrays
cannot find them. Machines arrive on the beach and leave defective.

I. ANCIENT OVERTURE OF HÉ﻿RODIADE
 
The Nurse
 (Incantation)
 
Abolished, and her frightful wing in the tears
Of the basin, abolished, that mirrors forth our fears,
The naked golds lashing the crimson space,
An Aurora—heraldic plumage—has chosen to embrace
Our cinerary tower of sacrifice,
Heavy tomb that a songbird has fled, lone caprice
Of a dawn vainly decked out in ebony plumes…
Ah, mansion this sad, fallen country assumes!
No splashing! the gloomy water, standing still,
No longer visited by snowy quill
Or fabled swan, reflects the bereaving
Of autumn extinguished by its own unleaving,
Of the swan when amidst the cold white tomb
Of its feathers, it buried its head, undone
By the pure diamond of a star, but one
Of long ago, which never even shone.
 
Crime! torture! ancient dawn! bright pyre!
Empurpled sky, complicit in the mire,
And stained-glass windows opening red on carnage.
 
The strange chamber, framed in all the baggage
Of a warlike age, its goldwork dull and faint,
Has yesteryear’s snows instead of its ancient tint;
And its pearl-gray tapestry, useless creases
With the buried eyes of prophetesses
Offering Magi withered fingers. One,
With floral past enwoven on my gown
Bleached in an ivory chest and with a sky
Bestrewn with birds amidst the embroidery
Of tarnished silver, seems a phantom risen,
An aroma, roses, rising from the hidden
Couch, now void, the snuffed-out candle shrouds,
An aroma, over the sachet, of frozen golds,
A drift of flowers unfaithful to the moon
(Though the taper’s quenched, petals still fall from one),
Flowers whose long regrets and stems appear
Drenched in a lonely vase to languish there…
An Aurora dragged her wings in the basin’s tears!
 
Magical shadow with symbolic powers!
A voice from the distant past, an evocation,
Is it not mine prepared for incantation?
In the yellow folds of thought, still unexhumed,
Lingering, and like an antique cloth perfumed,
Spread on a pile of monstrances grown cold,
Through ancient hollows and through stiffened folds
Pierced in the rhythm of the pure lace shroud
Through which the old veiled brightness is allowed
To mount, in desperation, shall arise
(But oh, the distance hidden in those cries!)
The old veiled brightness of a strange gilt-silver,
Of the languishing voice, estranged and unfamiliar:
Will it scatter its gold in an ultimate splendor,
And, in the hour of its agony, render
Itself as the anthem for psalms of petition?
For all are alike in being brought to perdition
By the power of old silence and deepening gloom,
Fated, monotonous, vanquished, undone,
Like the sluggish waters of an ancient pond.
 
Sometimes she sang an incoherent song.
Lamentable sign!
                             the bed of vellum sheets,
Useless and closed–not linen!—vainly waits,
Bereft now of the cherished grammary
That spelled the figured folds of reverie,
The silken tent that harbored memory,
The fragrance of sleeping hair. Were these its treasure?
Cold child, she held within her subtle pleasure,
Shivering with flowers in her walks at dawn,
Or when the pomegranate’s flesh is torn
By wicked night! Alone, the crescent moon
On the iron clockface is a pendulum
Suspending Lucifer: the clepsydra pours
Dark drops in grief upon the stricken hours
As, wounded, each one wanders a dim shade
On undeciphered paths without a guide!
All this the king knows not, whose salary
Has fed so long this agèd breast now dry.
Her father knows it no more than the cruel
Glacier mirroring his arms of steel,
When sprawled on a pile of corpses without coffins
Smelling obscurely of resin, he deafens
With dark silver trumpets the ancient pines!
Will he ever come back from the Cisalpines?
Soon enough! for all is bad dream and foreboding!
On the fingernail raised in the stained glass, according
To the memory of the trumpets, the old sky burns,
And to an envious candle it turns
A finger. And soon, when the sad sun sinks,
It shall pierce through the body of wax till it shrinks!
No sunset, but the red awakening
Of the last day concluding everything
Struggles so sadly that time disappears,
The redness of apocalypse, whose tears
Fall on the child, exiled to her own proud
Heart, as the swan makes its plumage a shroud
For its eyes, the old swan, and is carried away
From the plumage of grief to the eternal highway
Of its hopes, where it looks on the diamonds divine
Of a moribund star, which never more shall shine!

                ","
Eat cereal. Read the back of the box over and over. Put on my red velvet jumper with white heart shaped buttons. Walk to the bus, pick up discarded cigarette butts and pretend to smoke.
 
Get on the bus. Girls yell, Wire head, ugly black skin. Take a window seat, under the radio speaker. Look for cats hunting in the fields.
 
Go to class. Stay in at recess. Steal chewing gum, plastic green monkeys and cookies from desks. Eat in bathroom stalls. Pure white light pours in.
 
Try to get a bloody nose by punching myself in the same bathroom after lunch.
 
The teacher passes around pictures of herself pregnant. You were fat! I yell.  Everyone laughs. I lap it like licking honey from a spoon. I was pregnant, what’s your excuse? Everyone laughs. I swallow stones.
 
Grow tired in the afternoons, droop like a sunflower in the lengthening light.
 
Get on the bus. Girls yell, Brillo-head! Zebra! Sit in an aisle seat. Your father’s a nigger! I say, No, he’s a fireman. Laughter all around. Pinch myself shut like squeezing soap from a sponge.
 
Walk home. Sometimes find an unsmoked cigarette in the gravel along the curb—long, white, new. Put it to my lips, pull it away and hold it aloft, movie-star-like, all the way home.

When my dad first started to die
All my mom could remember
Was the time he kicked her out
After they first started dating
So that he could go play golf

When we feel death upon us
I remember he died twice
And once in my dream
I just had to see him all nursed and swaddled as if he were sleeping
But he wasn’t sleeping
I stood in the white light of the nursing home bathroom
With the sun spilling everywhere on me
And tried to talk to him, but never, he’d never listen
People don’t always listen to you when they are dead
But that’s not sad
I get tired
And I don’t listen to one Goddamn thing you are saying
But that is because most of the time you bore me
And when I am finally asleep it is really nice just to dream
I have seen a lot of things in this life
But one thing I saw most readily
Was that despite his eternal heartbreak
And girlish silliness
Mike’s face was kind of sweet, a sweet wind

Last night I dreamed I ran through the streets of New York
Looking for help for you, Nicanor.
But my few friends who are rich or influential
were temporarily absent from their penthouses or hotel suites.
They had gone to the opera, or flown for the weekend to Bermuda.
At last I found one or two of them at home,
preparing for social engagements,
absently smiling, as they tried on gown after gown
until heaps of rich, beautiful fabric were strewn
over the chairs and sofas. They posed before mirrors,
with their diamonds and trinkets and floor-length furs.
Smiling at me from the mirror, they vaguely promised help.
They became distracted—by constantly ringing phones,
by obsequious secretaries, bustling in with packages,
flowers, messages, all the paraphernalia,
all part of the uninterruptible rounds of the rich,
the nice rich, smiling soothingly, as they touched their hair
or picked up their phone extensions.
Absently patting my arm, they smiled, “It will be all right.”
 
Dusk fell on the city as I ran, naked, weeping, into the streets.
I ran to the home of Barbara, my friend,
Who, as a young girl, rescued four Loyalist soldiers
from a Spanish prison;
in her teenage sweater set and saddle shoes and knee socks,
she drove an old car sagging with Loyalist pamphlets
across the Pyrenees all the way to Paris without being caught.
And not long ago, she helped save a group of men
from Franco’s sentence of death.
 
In my dream, Barbara telephones Barcelona.
I realize this isn’t quite right,
but I just stand there paralyzed, as one does in dreams.
Then, dimly, from the other end of the line,
through the chatter of international operators,
we hear artillery fire, the faint tones of lost men,
cracked voices singing, “Los Quartros Generales” through the pulsations
of the great, twisted cable under the ocean.Agonía, agonía, sueño, fermente & sueño.Este es el mundo, amigo, agonía, agonía.
 
“No, Barbara!” I scream. ""We are not back there.
That’s the old revolution. Call up the new one.”
Though I know that, every day,
your friends, Nicanor, telephone Santiago,
where the number rings and rings and rings
with never an answer. And now the rings
are turning into knells:
 
The church bells of Santiago
tolling the funeral of Neruda, his poems looted,
his autobiography stolen, his books desecrated
in his house on Isla Negra.
And among the smashed glass, the broken furniture,
his desk overturned, the ruined books strewn over the floor,
lie the great floral wreaths from the Swedish academy,
the wreaths from Paris, South Asia, the whole world over.
And the bells toll on…
Then I tell Barbara to hang up the phone.
 
She dials the number again, then turns to me, smiling,
smiling like an angel:
“He is there.” Trembling, I take the phone from her,
and hear your voice, Nicanor,
sad, humorous, infinitely disillusioned,
infinitely consoling:
“Dear Carolyn…” It is Nicanor!
And the connection is broken, because I wake up,
in this white room, in this white silence,
                   in this backwater of silence
on this Isla Blanca:
                   Nicanor, Nicanor,

to wear black. I have met them as young as fourteen –
Beck’s friend Kristin had written her autobiography
already, it was called ‘These Days’ but it was stuck
 
in her computer somewhere, in the shed
at her mother’s. Her mother and the girlfriend,
they were also storm spirits.
They taught swimming
and they were kind at first, often charming
 
After watching the birds’ mating rituals
on the forest floor at the bottom of the steep train,
under the speckled trees, we decide to go north.
We borrow Beck’s sister Jade’s car,
and Alecto gets her licence first go.
 
We hear the Sibyl is staying at the Isis Motel.
This time there’s no bush festival, no whip-plaiter,
the pumpkins from the scarecrow bellies
have all been eaten in baked dinners cooked for the
Lamb and Potato Festival. That will be fifty-three dollars.
 
The others shower and go to bed, I’m as usual awake.
At night across the road, five types of frogs set up
their orchestra, and the Mother of Ducks lagoon throbs
around the gazebo – tree frogs like the ones at home
chaka-chaka, chaka-chaka
 
I go out and unroll my sleeping bag on the picnic table
suspended over the lagoon, and watch
the sun come up over the railway line.
In the distance across a golf course, I see smoke
and walking I come to a woman in black near a tent.
 
The Cumaean Sibyl, I presume? I say.
She laughs in her mantle, invites me in.
– So you’ve left the infernal regions too, I say
and she laughs again, going out and poking kindling
under the damp logs. I notice a laptop on her sleeping-bag.
 
She’s written a book about birds in New England
which she shows me. No one reads it, she says,
except ornithologists. She’s now writing a manual
for editors. When she goes out to the fire
I look at her hand-written page
 
‘Parts of a publication: sections and paras,
signposts and transitions, running heads and feet.’
Any news from home? I ask.
The singer is failing to get his wife back, she says.
The ferry man batted him back with an oar.
 
I prophecy he’ll be torn to pieces, she says,
and offers to cook me some kidney.
Where are your sisters? she asks.
I say they’re at the motel.
Well, they won’t be getting kidney, she says.
 
Our New England holiday over, and no other prophecies
from the Sibyl, we’re drive south through the Moonbi Hills
and down past the Emirates’ horse stud at Murrurrundi
through bull-dozed mountains the Sibyl says you once went round,
past the cones of a giant power station and the sign:
 
Muswellbrook – City of Power. And on to the Newcastle freeway.
Back in Sydney at the hostel, the girl at the front desk leans forward:
Have we heard? About Beck? She’s sorry, Beck has been killed
in a car accident near Bulahdelah.
Automatically I touch my dreads and groan.

A drunk cadet had hit them on a bad bend near the river,
two broken necks. On the notice-board there’s an A4 page
with a blurred digital photo of Beck laughing, leaning
into her friends in a nightclub and below that, writing:
We Love You Beck – from Kristin, Colette and Mandy.
 
I sit like an automaton in the big lounge room
my back teeth snapping against each other,
rocks in my gut. That night we watch on an iMac
a video of Beck, an eight minute film Colette
had taken on her phone.
 
Two of the men are crying. Kristin and Mandy are numb.
I move to the noticeboard, reading anything:
‘Live-in nanny required Balmain 5 min from city’
‘Experience life on an outback station help mustering
mobs of 2000 animals on horseback or quadbike’.
 
Near me two women are whispering. Talking
about their first-ever girlfriend. One says,
Other people are always either versions or not-versions
of her. Fourteen, it’s an age to break your heart. You know
nothing. On the edge of knowing too much.
 
I lean forward, my head on the foyer koala.
Voices travel to me from distant realms:
I hear again the singer’s plea for his wife.
Blurred from too much experience
I prowl around the leaflet racks, groaning.
 
Late that night on the vinyl lounges the people remaining
are Kristin and me, alone. My eyes are swollen,
my ears still buzzing from the headphones at work.
We talk over Beck till no more can be said.
Now Kristin begins to tell her own story
 
how her uncle had his boat down the back
of their block, and one day 
he said he wanted to show her something,
took her down the lantana path to the boat,
something she might like, he said –
 
Kristin was raped at times twice a day
or sometimes not for a week
and sometimes after it he gave her pocket
money once a twenty dollar bill which down
the gully later she tore into thin red strips and buried.
 
Back at the house her mother
bashed her for lying about the uncle,
who was her brother, and who had loaned them
the deposit on the house where Kristin and Odette
her sister were fortunate enough to live.
 
When Kristin grew up, her mother apologised to her.
The uncle was still alive. He had sent her a
Christmas card this year. She sat on the lounge,
looking down at her runners, her mouth closed.
Behind her the stereogram and Elvis, a silent witness.
 
The uncle had said she was a rude girl, she should
keep quiet about their secret otherwise
he’d give her little sister a taste of the same.
Kristin was quiet from then on. The reason she was
telling me now, her hand on my arm
 
was that last week she’d had a call from Odette
who was living in London.
The uncle during those primary
school years had done the same to her, tricked her
the same way, used the same words.
 
I feel the weight of my empty useless arms.
But later I hold her – hug her goodnight.
She touches my shoulder. I was convinced, she says,
I was saving my sister.
My head clatters: Virgin, May I help you?
 
Back in the Furies’ bunk-room it’s beauty night,
they’re whisking egg whites for a face mask …
After they’ve done each other they sit me on the bed
and paint my face with their fingers
the egg white sets quickly and they tell me not to smile.
 
I dream of Alecto’s iron tower and bloody clothes –
then I’m on TV being interviewed: So, the oldest Fury –
and who is your god? I am asked – I once served Artemis, I say.
And before that? – Athena, I say – Anath, Isis.
I do not mention Dionysis or the Thracian women.

from our deep cool verandah we spy on the world passing by. we both wear glasses in order to pick out the details. even as children we noticed all. people would say dont like those twins they look at you funny. we were reassured. our powers had been confirmed. but that was a long while ago. now we are 60. we have lived in this ground floor flat on the main road for 20 years. it is a very suitable dwelling, and we have a satisfactory relationship with the landlord. we think he is pleased we notice his transparency. we have been here since we left our husbands who got in the way of our observations.
 
after our evening meal we talk quietly of what we have seen. we believe in sharing our observations in case one of us has missed something. for our eyesight isnt as sharp as it was ten years ago. though we do clean our glasses each hour and keep our hair tied firmly back in small grey buns so nothing can distract our focus. we are small women. many people do not notice us, while we are noticing them. we keep to ourselves. mother used to say to us never get too friendly with strangers they can harm you. even if they smile and offer you an hour of their lives dont tell them nothing. mother knew a lot. she always kept the bible and a cloth to clean her hands on the kitchen table within reach.
 
at night we take turns to sit at the window and watch. we set the alarm at 2 and 6. this way we both get some sleep. theres always something to see along this road. even at 3 in the morning. last night we saw a woman in a torn fur coat, gum boots and a beanie blow up balloons, tie them on her arms as if they were wings. she climbed up a tree, spread her arms and jumped. we think she might have injured herself. she screamed for quite a while until one of the passing motorists stopped and rang for an ambulance. we didnt want to get involved. our slippers might have gotten wet. it had been raining quite heavily.
 
another night one of the local drunks fell asleep on our verandah. he smelt wretched but we were pleased to be able to get a closer look at him. for several weeks we had been trying to work out a few things about him. at least we were able to see how thick and long the scar on his bald head was. we were able to read the words on his tattoos, ‘dearest jean’ and ‘sailor boy’. we also saw a thin line thru the word ‘jean’ as if he had tried to cut the word out. very interesting. we scrubbed the verandah with disinfectant the next morning. it didnt take long.
 
we keep records of our observations in a private code in large journals. we are saving them up for the day when our memories fail us. then we can read them thru to recall the details. they are an assurance that our days have been full and busy. we put black velvet covers on these books. they are so soft to stroke. just like the backs of our 8 black cats who often sleep like guardians in front of the cupboard as if they recognised the importance of its contents.
 
there are many folks with bad legs along this road. they hobble ever so slowly up and down all day as if they had all the time in the world. they bandage their legs in different ways. some of the bandages are rather grubby. you’d think theyd wash them. there are plenty of laundromats around here. every pension day they could wash them. they could share a machine. you can fit a good deal in one of these contraptions – at least ten bandages. dear me. if theyd looked where they were going instead of expecting life to do everything for them, they wouldnt be in this predicament. we’re so pleased we’re not handicapped. we have only ourselves to thank. and of course mother.
 
pension morning is always busy. we always make sure the teapot is full by 9.30. the crowd gathers outside the bank. for at least  half an hour. theres no time to get up and put the jug on for some time. they clutter the footpath. so many of them. it takes a while for us to sort out who’s there. we sometimes use the journal if we cant quite locate every face. often its the only way to really know who died before the postman called. on our deep cool verandah we sit. the twins. there are no mirrors in our hallway.

My God, most glad to look, most prone to hear,         An open ear, oh, let my prayer find,                And from my plaint turn not thy face away.                Behold my gestures, hearken what I say,         While uttering moans with most tormented mind, My body I no less torment and tear. For, lo, their fearful threat’nings would mine ear,         Who griefs on griefs on me still heaping lay,                A mark to wrath and hate and wrong assigned;                Therefore, my heart hath all his force resigned         To trembling pants; death terrors on me pray; I fear, nay, shake, nay, quiv’ring quake with fear.   Then say I, oh, might I but cut the wind,         Borne on the wing the fearful dove doth bear:                Stay would I not, till I in rest might stay.                Far hence, oh, far, then would I take my way         Unto the desert, and repose me there, These storms of woe, these tempests left behind. But swallow them, O Lord, in darkness blind,         Confound their counsels, lead their tongues astray,                That what they mean by words may not appear.                For mother Wrong within their town each where,         And daughter Strife their ensigns so display, As if they only thither were confined.   These walk their city walls both night and day;         Oppressions, tumults, guiles of every kind                Are burgesses and dwell the middle near;                About their streets his masking robes doth wear         Mischief clothed in deceit, with treason lined, Where only he, he only bears the sway. But not my foe with me this prank did play,         For then I would have borne with patient cheer                An unkind part from whom I know unkind,                Nor he whose forehead Envy’s mark had signed,         His trophies on my ruins sought to rear, From whom to fly I might have made assay.   But this to thee, to thee impute I may,         My fellow, my companion, held most dear,                My soul, my other self, my inward friend:                Whom unto me, me unto whom did bind         Exchanged secrets, who together were God’s temple wont to visit, there to pray. Oh, let a sudden death work their decay,         Who speaking fair such cankered malice mind,                Let them be buried breathing in their bier;                But purple morn, black ev’n, and midday clear         Shall see my praying voice to God inclined, Rousing him up, and naught shall me dismay.   He ransomed me; he for my safety fined         In fight where many sought my soul to slay;                He, still himself to no succeeding heir                Leaving his empire shall no more forbear         But at my motion, all these atheists pay, By whom, still one, such mischiefs are designed. Who but such caitiffs would have undermined,         Nay, overthrown, from whom but kindness mere                They never found? Who would such trust betray?                What buttered words! Yet war their hearts bewray.         Their speech more sharp than sharpest sword or spear Yet softer flows than balm from wounded rind.   But my o’erloaden soul, thyself upcheer,         Cast on God’s shoulders what thee down doth weigh                Long borne by thee with bearing pained and pined:                To care for thee he shall be ever kind;         By him the just in safety held away Changeless shall enter, live, and leave the year: But, Lord, how long shall these men tarry here?         Fling them in pit of death where never shined                The light of life, and while I make my stay                On thee, let who their thirst with blood allay         Have their life-holding thread so weakly twined That it, half-spun, death may in sunder shear.

The job was easy: I tucked
them in, kicked off my shoes, listened for
the floor to go quiet. Everyone
slept except one: outside her door,
she paced, she hummed, holding
the edge of her torn
nightgown. Pointing, I told
her: to bed. Your bed. But she would not
stay there. She was old,
older than my mother: manic, caught
up in gibberish, determined to
sleep on my cot—
At first it was just to
quiet her. I could only sleep
if she slept, and I needed relief
from myself. That is how she
became a body next to mine
whether or not I wanted there to be
a body. She climbed
into my bed. I let her
sleep hot and damp against my spine.
All night she rocked, she turned,
she poked her spastic elbows
into my calves and slurred
her broken noises in the dark. All the old
fans went round in clicks
those summer nights—and she rolled
in bed and kicked
me in the head and I was
happy. No words, no tricks,
I just didn't love
my loneliness. My mind
felt cooler
with her there. Beside
her, I could have been anyone.
She had no word for me and not the kind
of mind to keep one.
And if she kicked
me, some nights, just
for the fun of it—who was I
to disappoint my one?
Sometimes I imagine I
was someone she won
at a fair as the wheel spun
under the floating, unfaltering sun
and clicked each lucky one
and one
until I was happily undone.

How lovely it is not to go. To suddenly take ill.
Not seriously ill, just a little under the weather.
To feel slightly peaked, indisposed. Plagued by
a vague ache, or a slight inexplicable chill.
Perhaps such pleasures are denied
to those who never feel obliged. If there are such.
How pleasant to convey your regrets. To feel sincerely
sorry, but secretly pleased to send them on their way
without you. To entrust your good wishes to others.
To spare the equivocal its inevitable rise.
How nice not to hope that something will happen,
but to lie on the couch with a book, hoping that
nothing will. To hear the wood creak and to think.
It is lovely to stay without wanting to leave.
How delicious not to care how you look,
clean and uncombed in the sheets. To sip
brisk mineral water, to take small bites
off crisp Saltines. To leave some on the plate.
To fear no repercussions. Nor dodge
the unkind person you bug.
Even the caretaker has gone to the party.
If you want something you will have to
get it yourself. The blue of the room seduces.
The cars of the occupied sound the wet road.
You indulge in a moment of sadness, make
a frown at the notion you won't be missed.
This is what it is. You have opted to be
forgotten so that your thoughts might live.

All summer we played Cossacks and Bandits,
shot our symbolic rifles and revolvers
and when killed would crush a wild cherry
in the breast pocket, the spot where the heart stopped.
Who started it? The red spreading over white satin
never to be washed away completely,
“I killed you! I killed you!” I screamed
as he fell down. Men found him three years later
in the abandoned mine after an explosion,
his clothes covered with coal dust and blood.
Women howled like wolves. “It’s nothing,
he’ll get up,” I thought, “it’s just that stupid
wild cherry on his shirt.”

I'm remembering again, the day
we stood on the porch and you smoked
while the old man told you
about his basement full of wine,
his bad heart and the doctor's warning,
how he held the dusty bottle out to you,
glad, he said, to give it away
to someone who appreciated
its value and spirit, the years
it took to settle into its richness
and worth. I'm watching again,
each cell alive, as you reach
for the wine, your forearm exposed
below the rolled sleeve, the fine hairs
that sweep along the muscle, glowing,
lifting a little in the afternoon breeze.
I'm memorizing the shape of the moment:
your hand and the small bones
lengthening beneath the skin
as it tightens in the gripping,
in the receiving of the gift, the exact
texture and color of your skin,
and the old man's face, reduced
to its essence. That,
and the brief second
when both of you had a hand on the bottle—
the thing not yet given,
not yet taken, but held
between you, stoppered, full.
And my body is flooded again
with an elemental joy,
holding onto it against another day
in the unknowable future when I'm given
terrible news, some dark burden
I'll be forced to carry. I know
this is useless, and can't possibly work,
but I'm saving that moment, for balance.

Sometimes it feels like it is over and it's not.
Sometimes it feels like it has just begun and it's over.
It's dark often at these times.
Urban though, so a certain version of light too.
It's hard to predict if it will start on time or how late.
I'm often a little late and it has started. Last night, I could tell from the
      copters overhead that I was late. 
As I walked up, the blocks around it were emptying out.
Parents pulled their children home.
The night herons settled into trees.
That's the outer ring.
As I got closer, all that was left were the blinking lights of the motor-
      cycles blocking the intersections and the men and few women in
      uniforms that mill about the corner, helmets in their hands. They
      talked among themselves. Ignored me mainly. One told me how to
      get around. I did not clarify that I was walking towards. 
You can hear it sometimes. It often has a soundtrack. Sometimes it has 
       drums and brass. Sometimes just joy.
When I am late I am trying to guess its path. Last night, several times I 
       got close to it only to be turned back by a line of cops.
They let the media through but turned me back.
Then it turned the corner and there it was.
At that moment, I melted my body into it and it embraced me.
Rosy fingered dusk and all that.
Come here, it sang, listen.
And then I was borne along by the waves all night and the whirlpool,
      the fig tree, and I was the bat, hanging on patiently.
Aarav came up and hugged me.
Someone grabbed me from behind and I thought it is Artem but later
     realized it was Berat. So much mask.
I grabbed Charlotte's hand and held it for a while when things felt
       dicey.
It felt dicey as they cornered us from two sides and we went down the
       tight side street, up the hill. Charlotte's hand.
It's like that.
Moving from isolation to the depths of friends.
At first we didn't mask up. We were poets.
Then slowly one by one we did.
As we got turnt.
As I got turnt I mean.
Sometimes I still don't mask up. It often feels hubristic.
I keep a bandana in my pocket.
It isn't super effective. It falls down a lot.
Last night, I tied it around my neck as we walked up the side street hill.
      I pulled it over my face as I walked past the line of cops. I noticed
      Emma there, throwing eggs. I ducked. Two balloons filled with
      paint flew by. Visors suddenly yellow.
She said to me, how is your heart?
And I at first worried her question.
Then I realized she meant my heart and how it was turnt.
It is good, I said, I am opening it; I am expanding it.
And I meant it.
I love you I texted Felix.
Lub u!!!!!! I texted Haruto.
Texting Isabella and Jackson, I love you guys.
I miss you.
I texted love you some forty-three times in the last few years.
I texted <3 some thirty-three times.
Lub u, eighteen times.
Miss you, thirty-eight.
She said your feed is all riots, plants, picnics, and poets.
It was an accusation.
She was noticing that I had got turnt.
And I said, my son, my son is in my feed too.
I didn't bother to argue the riot with her.
Still, oh that moment.
Turnt moment:
I was at the poetry reading and Mia didn't go. She was supposed to
       read too but she didn't. She said she wanted to see what happens.
       Then she texts I love you and I know then that Trader Joe's has
       been looted. All the wines out in the street.
Such sweet elixir, FOMO.
Then the rest of that night.
We quickly say good-byes after the reading, refuse the offer of going to 
      drinks, careen from the reading to our home. One of us on twit-
      ter the entire time. Texting too. While we are driving, one of us at
      home runs out into the streets, towards the gas. I drive up and two
      of us get out of the car and I stay in the car and drive the few blocks
      home. My son has fallen asleep in the back. I am coughing in the
      car from the gas. He sleeps through it. I take him out and carry him
      up to bed. More texts. I love you, I text. Come by and get me when
      you are done.
Later that night, I go out again. Miguel stays home with Minjoon. I go
      to a fight party; Marxist v. Nihilist. No one knows which is which.
      Mohamed, my fighting teacher, fights. I miss it. I love you I text.
      She texts back I'm high on being slugged; my eyes are swollen; I
      lost; I'm turnt.
Standing outside, a woman gets kicked out of the club. The bouncer
      tosses her out and into us. She is fucked up. And this feels awful to
      her. Her arms wildly swinging indicate this awful feeling. It feels
      awful to us. Another woman tries to help her and she slugs her. She
      misses and the woman who she has tried to slug takes her, calms
      her down. I hear her saying I love you, I love you over and over.
      Later I will learn that she spent the entire night talking the woman
      down. It's like that. When turnt, sometimes one needs to be held.
Still later, I stand on the street, outside my house and watch the
      t-mobile get looted. A man tries to stop another man who has
      his hammer at the ready in front of the window. The man who is
      attempting to stop the hammer gets hit in the face with the butt
      of the hammer. I decide to go to bed. It is 3 am. I text Nathan and
      say I love you and I'll leave the key in the box for you. The march
      continues on, Nathan continues on, turns left a block away and
      then when Nathan texts me back I know the Whole Foods is looted
      and they are all drinking champagne, dancing. All of them will get
      a cold later.
Riot champagne becomes a term among us that winter.
I wasn't there but I was there too. My germs were there.
I too had that cold.
Is this poem too heroic?
I am sorry.
I worry it is.
Or I know it is.
We are turnt to mere vandals at moments. I'll admit it.
Every computer in that shop.
Every phone in that one.
Every car in that car lot.
I don't want it to be heroic but last night I turned the corner and Nor
      was there with her bike and when I saw her I said I love you and
      we walked down the street as each window was cracked. They got
      turnt. Eventually we disperse. I jog for a few minutes away and out
      of the kettle. We joke, circle back to watch a car burn. Oliver walks
      by. He is hurrying towards the dispersal. I love you we say to him as
      he heads off. The car burns. The fire truck arrives. As I stand there
      watching it, it is as if everyone I ever texted I love you to walks
      by. I love you we call out to each other.
A group of women walk by the car and stop to take photographs. So
      much joy they have. They are laughing with such triumph. Selfies
      and all. Turnt.
This poem is true. I have texted I love you and its variations over
     and over.
Sometimes I barely knew you.
But the names are not true.
This is not a coterie poem.
Is it a milieu poem?
Can it be a movement poem?
I took all the names of this poem and never wrote them in.
There is no electronic record of them.
I found a list of the most popular baby names for various countries in
      2015, the year in which I am writing this poem. I made a list, one
      male and one female from each list. Then I alphabetized it. And I
      put those names in this poem one by one. I got to O.
But Olivia, Saanvi, Santiago, Seoyeon, Sofia, Yui, and Zeynep, I love
      you too.

My memory of a perfect scent: pine, sage, and cypress;
My friends' faith in the power of rough and winding paths
to take me up a mountain and bring me back.
Specimens plucked from that mountain's pastures:
Indian paintbrush, sego lily, ordinary wildflowers.
How I got them is a story of friendship and passion
Nancy, now a doctor, once a shy sophmore in college
Her husband Mike, the second, better one, and their obsession
with the Great Outdoors—hence an Idaho address.
Boise's Northend is a throwback to neighborhoods American—nice
               homes
Next to two-story garden apartments down the street from a 
               mansion.
Bikes and dogs and hand-pushed lawn mowers.
Where they dwell is a bungalow that spirits Memphis, Tennessee
circa 1971:
The Who blasting off a turntable, marijuana-scented air, boys with
              long hair,
girls wearing their boyfriends' blue jeans, bourbon and acid.
Paperbacks, record albums, text books piled up—azaleas on the
              parkway;
a howl of buzzing bees late spring just before graduation.
Their bungalow has dueling computers and a real backyard.
While Nancy and Mike's boxes are slowly being unpacked,
Their bicycles are carefully racked inside their front door.
Everyone is a thief out West. If you leave your bikes on the porch
They disappear. If you find water, someone else will divert it.
There are those who fight about the wind. Others the sun.
All angling for rights—mineral, water, air—that only comes with
              political power.
Oh, my friends who love to hike, to ski, to bike and me, they love
Are driving me from Boise to Ketchum through mountain and 
               valley beauty.
High desert heat is clear, dry and when your body rises out of  a 
             chilly car,
BLAM.
From there you enter another air conditioning zone:
a general store at the edge of mountain lore.
This place has everything from Bibles to good bourbon.
I almost bought a foot long sausage. I almost bought a gun.
I did buy cowboy postcards, mostly made for fun.
Food and security. Winter just over the ridge, four weeks hence.
I used to watch Death Valley Days.
Death was hinted, but not shown—the wagon turned over,
The wagon train a going.
O, those long-suffering white people fearful of Indians and scared of
             bandits,
desperate for shade, for water, for land flowing milk and honey.
Hard-bitten men and sad-eyed women trekking.
How grand those verdant acres were to be.
What they got was land just green enough for wandering herds of
             long-horned beasts
and no where to farm, no where to hide.
Today, the wind machines whip around:                         BIG ENERGY.
Horses gambol and graze on that patch of land or this keen slope.
No wheat and corn, not even dope grows here.
But silver, gold, treasures unknown lode these mountains
inviting speculation, misery, and bad legislation.
A few miles up from Sun Valley, we enter a trail.
Mike and Nancy smile and cajole.
Straw hat and baseball cap attest to sun's plenty.
Their walking sticks to the rocks' ready
challenge to ankles and limbs.
Our water pouches are overflowing.
What were my friends thinking?
We slip and slide on the side of this mountain and step aside
for the sculpted women in tank tops and biker shorts—trotting as
               fast as
Nancy and Mike's favorite dog
She runs ahead following the blonde beauties until all is shadow.
We greet each other with glee.
I am the novice hiker. I am afraid of falling into thin air.
One large Black woman with a bum knee. What were they
             thinking?
She will love the smell. Pine, sage, and cypress.
She will love the sound. Wind shakes aspens. Water crinkles rock
She will love the sight. Wildflowers—whites, yellows, purples and
               reds:
Indian paintbrush, sego lily, the wily cinquefoil.
When friends give you what you need, what more can you ask?
Oh the pleasure in a mountain's power to quiet a panicked heart.
The glade refined.
Hawk's home, wolf's dream, bears far away.
Stewards of American beauty—these are the paths my friends make
               in wild places
—the rise and fall of future walks.
I salute their obsession for Idaho's red undulating hills.
Whose mountain ranges east to west like those in the Himalayas
says a guidebook, but ours is a different story—in this young
              mountain,
on these new hills, circumspect is the American West.
Where people steal
a drop of ore,
a native flower,
a piece of splendor
day in and day out.

The fools nearly killed me trying to make me one of them:
a loaded word of  bond with dress codes and penal codes,
postured allegiant to the culture as with the flying of flags
from knots tied on the back of  head wraps worn hoods over.
I can’t gunpoint when the life of this alter ego began though
the possibility can’t be dismissed it began at gunpoint in a way,
with an icy pressure against the temple, the mind splitting into two
tracks while a circus of peers clowned.Going back far too long
now, the camera has blurred my edges in the suggestion of motion
even if  I stood as still as the air does before shit really hits the fan.
I truly went ass-first into fronting indifference, forbade my happy
teeth from public reveal lest they pop the balloon of my perfectly
round face, baby-angled, already read as kind or innocent or soft
from the jump when I wanted respect on my name and women on
my lap like it was said I should. And, shamefully, I did. Several
sistas come to mind here and this doesn’t make me feel good;
a tender touch in the moonlight goes only so far for a shadow.
I had to break it down for myself that being down represented
the fear of having fear.I still shake when the wind blows,
scary as ever, thespian as always in all ways toward the ghost
of a threat or disrespect passed through me then through me,
through a thin skin then through the skin. So, to compensate—
a mask, what Dunbar’s bars beat home way back when about
standing in the presence of the pale folks, only that idea flipped
upside down, what’d be a forced smile slicing the face open like
some summertime melon instead setting scowl folds into smooth
forehead, brown eyes set at the mouth’s corners, fixing it in the
position of silence like rusty nails.If carrying nothing else,
I learned to bring this exact look to the danger because being me
to the fullest would be a liability, provide a sharper image for the
hidden cameras to home in on; yes, just that fast—a certified blue,
strolling up to the screen door with a heavy hand for knocking and
his true hand resting so sweetly on his gun. My gun, I should say,
since in this case the cop is also me, like that little angel or devil
used as sitcom trope.Just imagine the person coming for you
being  you every time: don’t trip, you’d say, unless into the fight.

Long after I stopped participating
Those images pursued me
I found myself turning from them
Even in the small light before dawn
To meet the face of my own body
Still taut and strong, almost too
Strong a house for so much shame
Not mine alone but also yours
And my brother’s, lots of people’s,
I know it was irrational, for whom I saw
Myself responsible and to whom
I wished to remain hospitable.
We had all been pursuing our own
Disintegration for so long by then
That by the time the other side
Began to raise a more coherent
Complaint against us we devolved
With such ease and swiftness it seemed
To alarm even our enemies. By then
Many of us had succumbed to quivering
Idiocy while others drew vitality from new
Careers as public scolds. Behind these
Middle-management professors were at pains
To display their faultless views lest they too
Find censure, infamy, unemployment and death
At the hands of an enraged public
Individuals in such pain and torment
And such confusion hardly anyone dared
Ask more of them than that they not shoot
And in fact many of us willed them to shoot
And some of us were the shooters
And shoot we did, and got us square
In the heart and in the face, which anyway
We had been preparing these long years
For bullets and explosions and whatever
Else. A vast unpaid army
Of self-destructors, false comrades, impotent
Brainiacs who wished to appear to be kind
Everything we did for our government
And the corporations that served it we did for free
In exchange for the privilege of watching one
Another break down. Sometimes we were the ones
Doing the breaking. We would comfort one another
Afterward, congratulating each other on the fortitude
It took to display such vulnerability. The demonstration
Of an infirmity followed by a self-justificatory recuperation
Of our own means and our own ends, in short, of ourselves
And our respect for ourselves—this amounted to the dominant
Rhetoric of the age, which some called sharing, which partook
Of modes of oratory and of polemic, of intimate
Journals and of statements from on high issued by public
Figures, whom at one time or another we all mistook ourselves for.
Anyway it wasn’t working. None of it was working.
Not our ostentation and not the uses we put our suffering
To, the guilt- and schadenfreude-based attention
We extracted from our friends and followers, and even the passing
Sensation of true sincerity, of actual truth, quickly emulsified
Into the great and the terrible metastasizing whole.
To the point it began to seem wisest to publish only
Within the confines of our own flesh, but our interiors
Had their biometrics too, and were functions not only
Of stardust, the universe as we now were prone to addressing
The godhead, but also of every mean and median of the selfsame
Vicious culture that drove us to retreat into the jail of our own bones
And the cramped confines of our swollen veins and ducts in the first place
Our skin was the same wall they talked about on the news
And our hearts were the bombs whose threat never withdrew
Images could drop from above like the pendulum in “The Pit
And the Pendulum” or killer drones to shatter the face of our lover
Into contemporaneous pasts, futures, celebrities, and other
Lovers all of whom our attention paid equally in confusion
And longing, and a fleeting sense like passing ghosts
Of a barely-remarked-upon catastrophe that was over
Both before and after it was too late. We were ancient
Creatures, built for love and war. Everything said so
And we could not face how abstract it was all becoming
Because it was also all the opposite of abstract, it was
Our flesh, our mother’s bloodied forehead
On the floor of Penn Station, and wherever we hid
Our face, amid a crowd of stars for example as Yeats
Once put it, and for stars insert celebrities
Or astrology here, your choice, and even when
We closed our eyes, all this was all we looked at
Every day all day. It was all we could see.
We were lost in a language of images.
It was growing difficult to speak. Yet talk
Was everywhere. Some of us still sought
To dominate one another intellectually
Others physically; still others psychically or some
Of all of the above, everything seeming to congeal
Into bad versions of sports by other means
And sports by that time was the only metaphor
Left that could acceptably be applied to anything.
The images gave us no rest yet failed over
And over despite the immensity
Of their realism to describe the world as we really
Knew it, and worse, as it knew us

what she told me. What I honor. They, as unambiguous as Lyrae is:
black, bard, badass; svelte with flourishing braids; a singularity and
somehow all of them gathered as one like tributaries to the mouth of
the river of God—Gwendolyn and Lucille and June and—and I can’t
count all the ways I was saved that day, emerging wet from the ritual
to find myself sitting in some stranger’s living room, a writer who’d
been pushed out of their homeland by its persecutions, pulled into
America on the promise of asylum, the same America that commits
my own kind to institutions with routine and rarely second thoughts
signaling the presence of conscience, and while we’re on the subject
of right and wrong, know I’d read the news recently and retreated far
into my unfeeling before I received the blessing of her timely word,
walking in bloody boots through hallways leading to the chambers
where tenderness is said to rest in all of us by symbology, but then
I was called outside my bones again. And let me tell you, my friend:
you’ve never seen light before you’ve seen it. I swear, it’s as if with
the snap of a finger I could recite the very definition of gold without
needing to run yolk from the promise of a child, a happy day’s glow
spilling into the street like July’s laughter from a fire hydrant as we
left the house with folk who loved words and loved us—loved us—
so expansively. And less than two nights later we’re all throwing our
asses in a circle, cuttin’ up, working up what was an effortless sweat,
undeterred even as the music skipped on every hiccup of the fraying
wires, tethered just as strenuously to joy as ever, like always, trying
to catch a good breath, but I paid it no mind, no mind, no mind—no,
I wasn’t absent upstairs exactly, I was hyper-present; what a ghost is
to death I was to life, inside everything simultaneously—the sub and
the synth, the blown-off roof and hole-stomped floor, the rise of
their chests and the fall—and only nigga returned me to this plane:my nigga, my nigga, a lyric left on my bottom lip like the sweet after-
burn of Hennessy, but yo, it’s like I was being called for, called out
of need since I know that word only has such resonance in a world
where we ain’t free. And, nah, we ain’t free, if you were wondering.
There are no shackles on me your eyes can see but none that I can’t
feel as if they were appendages divided from me by the occurrence
of civil war, a set of chimeless chains that could be yanked on and
bring me, even at my most upright, to my knees. And if it happens—
again—I suppose I could pray, there, at my literally lowest moment,
immersed in the mess they’ve made that I’m tasked with cleaning
up for the commendation of pennies. I hope I don’t get shot while
genuflect since that’s apparently a thing now in this country, but I
worry such a selfish ask won’t have sufficient fuel to reach heaven,
that the bastardized sparrow will burn up in the atmosphere as easily
as tissue paper. And I recognize I’m rambling now, but I’m likewise
increasing my odds of bumping into the point of all this since inside
the milk of me something was stirred by what she said, but it’s hard
to translate a muscular language to a verbal one just as it’s hard to
relate to folk who don’t consider their own demise fifty ’leven times
a day at least, and for that relapse not to be an injurious ideation but
an itch of practicality. What I wouldn’t pay for the chance to not pay
attention to every little thing—how they talk near me and how they
talk when they believe I’m nowhere near, what they do or don’t do
with each other that they do or don’t do with me, the questions they
feel quite content to ask me and the ones they never seem to though
I leave the door open, the window, the bleeding heart. I know them
so well, people who wouldn’t know me from the next in the lineup;
I know them so intimately you’d think I love them all, and the gag is
that I do, by some undesired miracle, and that is part of all this, too.
To say they don’t deserve my time is an obvious statement, but they
take it anyway because it’s all they know, evident as I recount every
transgression taking seconds off my time on this earth, summing up
to years, almost to the point I’m gone already, in response to which
I either swallow spit or spit out ellipses. Ask the wounded wall what
I know of restraint, the manifesto I’d pen with what pours out from
my punctured knuckles, though, perhaps, the poet was signaling that,
all along, I’ve been teaching the most important life lesson merely by
domesticating rage, confining it inside the margins of the flesh that
my parents made for me, the page my life is written against each day
in corrective red ink. And this seems like the appropriate moment
to divulge that her sermon came during a dialogue about poetic craft
of all things, but if poetry can’t be applied to how one moves through
this world then I see very little worth in it, which is where it started
for me. Poetry was a dead white thing in my life once, at the bottom
of the trash can with the doll of Jesus they’d tried pawning off on me
back in Catholic school, but luckily I already knew one for us, by us,
and thus found the inner-strength to soldier through the barren winter
of lyrical delight rocking a pair of big-ass Timberlands and other on-
trend threads a person of greater gravitas could’ve filled out better
around the shoulders. But I digress—since what I really mean to be
speaking on is how the Cavalier poets weren’t really doing it for me
during high school, not because their explicit sexuality or their taste
for material excess and ambitious proximity to the throne were such
disagreeable subjects to me, at the time revisiting rap’s mafioso era,
but because when we painted those same pictures as we preferred to,
our tongues spiraling like ballerinas and bullets, they sought the ban
on sale or talked down on it as being absent of any artistic merit, as if
a nation’s worth of people surviving subjugation is more science than
art anyway, for if that were true, then we wouldn’t have a culture and
America wouldn’t have great product to push to the rest of the planet
aside from all the bombs it seems much keener on dropping casually
like Funkmaster Flex, and I’d already grown tired in my young age,
so tired, of trying to prove I’m not stupid even above trying to prove
I’m smart. And those who doubt there’s a difference have digging
to do, deep into their pockets to get me what I’m owed for damages,
for emotional distress and all things it’s been made feasible to sue for
with solid legal representation. Funny, I once longed to be a lawyer,
little fool that I was, my back against a brick wall painted by spotlight,
rifles lined and aiming, in that night’s vision—legal fluency seemed
the only option for release from this burden because it’s the language
my nemeses speak in. I do know bad English from black, but I know
power even better because I’ve brushed up against it just as a person
in any number of neighborhoods around here may have brushed up
against a police officer. Maybe it’s needless to say I didn’t go down
an attorney path; I actually don’t have a plan at all these days except
evading the bullet and also the bullet points corporations thrive on,
as if any of this is simple, as if I, symptom of systemic dysfunctions
enveloped by skeleton and skin, am something simple. I’d only ever
be two-dimensional if airbrushed on a blank T-shirt and even that
would show depth to someone’s esteem for who I was with no one
else nearby, and all this means is that there is more to me or anyone
alike than being menace or miscreant, minstrel or misanthrope, or
murdered as all four would be with equal fanfare. But what I really
want is to know what they feel when their black friend dies in that
typical way for it’s maybe the only thing I don’t know about them,
while we practice poker faces and draft FAQs. Forget seeing eye to
eye for a second. Set aside the particular grammars of forgiveness
we use without pulling up the problem’s root: do they still feel full
people if they put the hammer down? And when they can’t answer,
make note that I can because I have those tools and also others that
shall remain nameless in order to remain purposeful. That’s how I
prefer it, besting all desertions of their decency, which I say since
you’ve caught me rare and raw tonight, sipping off the bottle top,
slurring my songs, hitting my two-step on beat every. single. time.
Damn—how blessed they are to be able to watch me work around
them—as illegibly as what the miraculous Phillis Wheatley wrote
all over her master’s walls, owned in the moment, I feel, solely by
an ambition toward self-definition I also try applying prodigiously,
bringing them to speechlessness, a shaming kind of silence sayinglisten, leave me be because there’s no explaining me, thus there’s
no exploiting me: what only a history under thumb and foot helps
grasp before letting go, for one’s own good even more than mine.

Of  that string of memories about our lost friendship I rememberbeing invited places as a pair, like a comedy team; and afterone party, our self-parody of our own stammeringspeechlessness when introduced to Henrik, the Swedish godauto mechanic; our twin, garish, purple-flowered swimsuitsfrom Kmart, outlining, around Texas, our samenessand differences; our dual waitressing shifts across town,and the long phone calls that followed with their emphaticreiteration of every stingy six-top ordering candy-flavoredalcoholic drinks; the after-work visit where we brayed,stomped, then blinked stupidly (while the needle hitthe LP’s end) at the empty fifth of gin left on the coffee table,prompting a dim: Uh oh; your imitation of your mother’shabitual and by-the-way inexplicable confession about youto shoe salesmen: She has a  funny foot; the apartments,the Olivettis, the boyfriends, all the thoughts exchangedunedited like an experiment of the big, walk-in consciousness,which we might have assumed the verbal equivalentof sex for friends, and whatever closeness meant, we wantedas much as we could have, it was our post-graduate workin The Humanities. Even now, I can’t resist striking upa conversation while standing on line, any line, or introducingmyself enthusiastically to whomever I am introduced,but the truth is I am not looking for new friends at this point;I am trying to locate the lost ones, the ones who leftthrough the hole of an argument decades ago,a time more panicked and carefree than any other, except maybethe early years of motherhood, which I missed sharingwith you on playground benches. But surely I will see youon the bus someday, and your greeting will packageour jokes, advice, tears, book talk, our years of reliance.And so I will expect you will tell me how much I havemisunderstood and wrongly assumed in these descriptions,because I never expect those people who have matteredto remain completely gone, even through death, or rebuke.And of course I have to remember what parted us,that I found faults with your other friends, that I spokeas critically and crassly about them as I did about my own person,and to this day I have to be careful of that trait, my junkyarddog of expression, safe only with me on a too-long leash. Here,again, telling you everything with no reason but formemory’s insistence that I string an apology from what I see.

I was making a new friend,
blonde-gray, a living opal,
pellucid, also reminding me
of a green apple
napping underneath its tree,
where I have tumbled too,
being of an age, “elderly”
but undepressed, she
tall enough to change
the smoke alarm — sharing
a ripeness that we liked comparing,
bosses who couldn’t see us,
perforation by divorce,
retirement, and stairs.
One lunch that I was looking forward to,
the first thing on her mind — 
“Do you believe in the Occult?” — 
“Merline! No, I don’t think so.”
She was in an auditorium — 
her older, deader sister sat
right down beside her
with a message — a large figure
not her body but a sum — 
what did it mean? I’d thought
one of us leaned forward at the lectern
but a ghost was there, holding sway,
or forth. Well, it came true — 
she’s richer by that sum — 
and urges making sure
to be attentive to my dreams.
She knows that it will happen — 
I’m her friend, as the Occult has been so far.
I didn’t want my brother
appearing in a dream
to bring me news of unexpected
income — if only I would pray
about it first — to the God
who had my brother die
after all. And certainly not
my sister prophesying ill
on my behalf. I guess I’d stand up,
put on a mike, look out at all
the empty faces, make them
look alive, and even cheer.
Had I remembered a firsthand poltergeist,
a temptatious legend ... 
I guess I’d accept a sleek Angora bunny
in a mohair hat, or magic
like a two-dollar bill, ask for
a life my brother could have back.

They remember the dead who died in the resistance.   
It is in sweet tones that they speak of them.

Walking back to the car, while an evening snow   
That has started windlessly, white from pearl-gray,   
Falls into streets that are already slushy.
They shake their heads, as we do when there is something   
Too strange to believe,
Or as a beast does, stunned by a blow.
“To die in the resistance,”   they say, “is to fail   
To turn into slush, to escape this ugliness.   
It is at once to leap, a creamy swan,
Upward.”   Three voices: oboe, piano, cello.
The high one wishes to be pleasing, the middle   
To be practical, the deep to persevere.

Into their lungs, a pain that is a pleasure.   
“Try to live as if there were no God,”   
They don’t say, but they mean.
A recollection of purity, a clean
Handkerchief each man feels in his own pocket,
Perturbs them, slows their pace down. Now they have seen
A yellow stain on a pile of old snow
Between two parked cars, where a man has peed:   
The resistance. The falling flakes, falling
On the men’s hats. And now
The snow grows heavier, falls on their stooping shoulders.

Friend, remember how you showed us beasts love beauty?
We were wading in your lake with bluegills and you said,
Be careful, you will lose your beauty marks
To their little jaws. We were a delicacy. From us they purchased
The darkest part of the skin, only what contrasts on us.
And it was more than a pinch or sting,
It’s a sensation of hunger
That makes us spring off the bottom and swim out deep
And safe. “No blue stripes on cheeks; no red on fins;
Old individual’s belly coppery red or brassy.”
As others see you, I think these indicate,
Who would have you all one shade then wouldn’t have you.
At your full table later, over muskellunge and lemon,
We read in the book the fish that liked us
Has certain maxillaries “wholly wanting.” Your gourmet bluegill:
It lives in the eye of the beholder, it swims the vitreous
Humor, would eat even your blind spot!
But we think we can paddle out there until all
Goes dark, and we are wholly desirable, and too much.

and ended up at midnight in Old Greenwich, Connecticut,

PART ONEI
Slip-pilings on the Brooklyn littoral
—the poles still tarry, flimsy; the ferry terminus
with its walledup doors wan doorshapes
on eroded sills. Downstream, the strutwork
of the Williamsburg cable tower
threw its cool shadow half a mile inland
over tarpaper seams, gantried water butts,
and splintery tenement cornices milled
with acanthus and classical grasses
of nineteenth-century dream-slum fantasy.
We could see, from our rooftops, the endspan
floating its ant-threads of traffic
to the granite salients of the anchorage,
and through its strands on the west
the Financial District’s watery silhouettes.
But it was our own foundations, crumbling
in the sandy soil, that made us protest
the drill rigs sounding for a wider bridge ramp
to funnel the airport traffic over us
into Manhattan. “Construction tremors
will weaken our buildings”: from the over-roosted
tenements clinging near the anchorage
flew manuscript lists of signatures, block-groups’
painfully Englished petitions. But City Hall
adoze, sleep-feeding, just flooded usII
with chimerical figures and blueprints,
wearing us down. Our own “block-leader,” Luz,
a Guatemalan law student at NYU
where I studied classics, distracted us
more easily with her “pure language”
or anti-Puerto Rican tirades. “Call that Spanish?
Take my sitter—muy indio, still speaks some
Maya mountain-language BUT
the beautiful Spanish!” And so one evening this sitter,
Pilar, came over—forty, perhaps, with a long
fawn-tinted oval face, and read in low tones
an archaic poem to the Madonna. “My daughter
knows it in Quiché and English—” and she passed around,
wistfully, a First Communion photo—flat cheekbones
like her mother’s, long black braids, straight look.
Luz told us Pilar had lost husband
and son to the Violence; a machine-gunned
death heap in the center of their village—
“They killed all the men. But when my family
came here, she came with her girl, we helped with the
green card, and she’s a hotel maid now
near the UN ...” Much realer, this, than our own
bridge-inflicted, some-day disaster. And who knew
but our bridge might metamorphose,
as the City said (“Global cities draw capital”), into a river
of money (“We’ll all sell cuchifritos on the ramp”),
and anyway, mainly, summerIII
was running out, with its open evenings
and windows. One Saturday, turning onto my block
from the subway, I heard my name, crossed
the street where twin buildings had area-ways.
and saw you waving, the same, Pilar,
from a window below the swag-bellied area railings.
“Come have some coffee—go around in back.”
I walked down the building-side, and turned in a trash-littered
airwell by a door with multiple doorbells.
You opened from a wooden hallway, unpainted,
with padlocked doors. “See, the super’s cut up his flat
for illegals. They took out an inside wall, so our room
has a window—we all share the bath.” I entered
a lime-walled room—chairs and table, sofa-bed. Your front wall
was the building front, the three others
drywall. On the bureau, a black-shawledprie-dieu: two photos; two candles in translucent, white-waxed sacks,
and a polychrome Madonna with meeting brows.
Through your window, car wheels, railings; and, above,
my own second-story windows. “We saw you
reading there,” you said from behind me, “when we moved in.”
You sat me on the sofa, and formally presented your daughter
(she moved her schoolbooks all to one end.) Near her, a shallow,
linoleumed-over trench and a bathroom sink. You said:
“I’m a widow from the mountains near Morache, very near
the home-town of Señora Luz. My real work is hotel maid, and I’ve got
a nice job, at a place called the Tricontinental.”
Then you paused, and I felt how clearly
you’d presented yourself, as Americans do, with your job,
your état civil, and I said: “I’m a graduate student
at NYU, where Luz studies, no, not married, no children ...”
I tried to add something else at once, to leave this less ...
definitive, but nothing came, so we ran through bridge-rumors,
and soon we were hardly listening, waiting
for our own next word, and laughing at our gabble. Pequita
told us what the priest had said
about the drilling; you spoke of Pequita’s
First Communion, and none of us could stop
finding striking things to say. Next day you came over
to see my plants, and I came back for soup-supper, looking up
at my windows, which in the easy half-yellow light
of autumn looked oddly beckoning. As we ate,
you leaned forward, with a sudden rogue’s smile,
and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge,
“There’s a path up there. If the bridge
is bad, we’ll tell off the Mayor—” (In what spirit, I wondered,
had you listened to our committee?) And when I got home
I looked down, and through your sheer curtains saw you
cleaning up, and Pequita, at the table, reading.IV
But next week, instead of the plank stair
that zigzags up the anchorage-side, we wandered
the riverside shipping alleys. From below, we could see
overhead the under-arch of the bridge, and feel
the resonant top-thrum of westbound
subways and trucks. Then the riverside—I loved
this part. A sort of post-industrial fenworld, with tiny
terrace houses, big dredger-parts laid aside
from the drillings, and abandoned wreckers’ lots
filled with sea-floor light and trembling, long-awned
panicles of switchgrass. Its timelessness
soothed me—though ephemeral. Even that day, one freshly
tuckpointed facade, and a pair of brandnew bronze
Edwardian mermaid doorknockers. I could see
our quarter five years from now, say—the withering
discount chains, tentative boutiques,
and mother and daughter figuring, to the upscale
“pioneers,” as neighborhood indigenes, living on
with strange literalness among them, supplying
their just-permissible quantum of urban grit.
You were ahead, and Pequita trailed us, rattling weed stalks
with a stray lath. As we progressed in and out
of the endspan’s slatted shadows, you turned
and called me into a side-lot—sunken concrete, flask-
green puddles, to a broken-off building wall. It had been
interior, once—rows of soiled roomsized
plaster squares trailing sawn pipes, with one high trembling
toilet, like a pearl. In a lower square, fringed
with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti,
was a mural. Muy latino: the mountain
dreaming the city: a terrace cafe with palm trees
and a dancer shawled in black lace, with inward-angled
castanets. And you lifted yourself on tiptoe,
Pilar, to touch the lace, as you might have grazed
Pequita’s cheek. I felt a pang, as if I already needed you
sturdy inside your sturdy body, not this gesture
as if, exiled within, you reached out— We stepped
back, museum-wise, to contemplate, and you said:
“Luz likes to say I’m some mountain-woman, but when
my mother died, I lived with my aunt in the City—I only
went back when I married.” I told her I’d lived
in this city, with a stepmother, who’d divorced my uncle
to marry my father; and beat me. “A stepmother’s
a curse of God,” you said gently. And on the walk back,
pointed out more wall palms, beaches, until New York
seemed a dot in a belt of capitals
high on the globe: world-cities, packed
with immigrants, refugees, Gastarbeiter: a snowy
latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia.V
We were a threesome. Coffee, suppers, TV,
Pequita at my computer—you’d asked me to teach her—
or sleeping on my sofa, one bad month
they moved you to night shift. Yet only that summer,
I’d worked in my window like a scholar
in a lamplit bay, the night filled with myriad noises,
like Roman Juvenal, to whose ears “came ever
the sounds of buildings collapsing.” Across, the two
tenement-faces, florid, all bucrania, meanders, dusky trails
of fire-escape bedding. And everything underlit
by the sinister, slow-stopping car lights of our street.
But now it was the dailiness of two
from another hemisphere. Through snow-fissures, winds fluting
on railings and building-flaws, Pilar in her low frame
paced with armfuls of laundry, washed
in the sink and hung to dry everywhere. The thousand
stratagems of those who simply must not spend;
and the tiny mother-decisions: though you preferred
periphery, housekeeping around her,
you’d make yourself interrupt her, to mop
behind your sweeping. And Pequita—I saw her wrap
you up on the sofa when you had flu, and bring you
orange juice, as they’d taught her in school, for she
loved you, she was the person who loved you—
I saw too, that of what I wanted the university
to be for me—a tiny model of the city
with its own rules and subsets: “Tell me
each day who I am”—you’d found your part
in Pequita; I followed the shape
of your day touching center as it funneled
into her hand and moving pencil-point.VI
For everything seemed natural to Pequita:
the Credo, her photocopied choir music
piled beside the tidy prie-dieu,
our neighborhood of syringe-filled gutters, drug-stoops and pimps,
her school’s turkey cutouts, metal detectors, backed-up toilets ...
Our human wilderness, half-urban, half-surreal
to her was a matter-of-fact Eden, like the picturesque ruins
and laughably rococo grottoes imagined
by the seicento as the Golden Age.
—And I, I thought her whole world, it comes back—
touching, as if her child’s paradisial will were there
for my affectionate recreation, like our still faithfully,
occasionally, typed-up and dispatched
protests from the Ramp Committee to the Mayor. Slight effects
of perspective, tiny human gestures
giving point to the city’s vast, ironic beauty.PART TWOVII
At a moment when no one was thinking
about her, Pequita awoke. Perhaps
she enjoyed the solitude, Pilar asleep,
me asleep across the street. She got up
and stood on the cheap oval bathroom rug
before the sink. At seven the drills started,
deeper-toned than ever before (they woke me)—
and part of your ceiling fell in; a beam
splintered, plummeting straight to the oval rug—
The person screaming over the phone
was Pilar. I thought it must be really
all right, or she’d be crying not screaming,
but when I’d called 911 and run over, Pequita
was barely alive.
Then the hospital corridors,
me trying to close my winter coat
(the buttons were off) on my nightgown, you
on a bench, staring straight ahead.
When they said Pequita was
“gone,” you were utterly silent. I brought you
to my place (though our street was a tangle
of police lights and yellow tape), terrified
of your fixed inner focus, as if you had
a plan ... Next night I had Luz stay over,
I slept at her place; the third I was back. You,
thank God (I thought), were crying, and Luz
had set up the service. She propelled us downstairs
and to a tiny brick church I must often have passed
without seeing it, two blocks inland.
Egg-blue inside, it was, with a little green
and gilt altar, dark Stations on the walls,
and the statue of the Virgin of Guadeloupe
placed oddly below the altar stairs, so that Pilar,
after the death-mass, could kneel
before her, praying straight into her face,
while I on a kneeler buried mine in my hands.
What would the mother live for now, the hotel, me, or Luz,
already writing more endless mad letters? Yet only these
had from the City real answers: they’d brace the drill site
with vibration-absorbing piers; and they wanted
her and her friend Mrs. Citrin to know
“that no one else had been more than lightly injured.”VIII
It was the end of winter, very dark. The building
managers, nervy, had moved you to the first floor
next door, till you found a new place (I knew
you weren’t looking). Each day I saw you
arrive from work, answer my call tersely,
then pull down your blinds. A shadow showed rarely,
flattened, shapeless; you lay on your sofa a lot.
“Thanks Anne—I’m better without company,” or
“please understand.” But often, later
in the evening, you’d come down the stairs
and turn inland. Then, one morning as I was passing
with early groceries, you were leaving the parish hall
in your black winter coat, heavily scarved,
and we paused. Approvingly, you tapped one glove
on my armload—you’d told me to cook more, dictated
recipes. I asked if this had been Pequita’s
choir-practice place; the sentence wavered,
but you replied with grim joy,
“She’s not practicing now.” It took me a minute.
Pequita was singing, this moment, in the Presence.
Still what you felt most (it was in your face)
was absence, absence, but from something bitter
in your eyes, that seemed small and round with the cold, I felt
your desire to exclude me and our old collusive ironies.
What were such luxuries now, ironies, Anglo friends;
and I thought you hated my mind
that remembered the brownpapered books,
the orange juice. I reached to touch your arm—to get past
this, but no, you had to get home:
“I fasted for communion”; and your eyes
swerved away. All my laughable,
my lovely, delusional studies, that I’d seen you
sort through for Pequita, were now an affront. And yet
I felt you moving behind your own mind, as if
with something held in reserve ...IX
But then you stopped answering the phone, went
less often to church. What I thought
was that you were angry (certainly I was). Perhaps
I thought you needed to talk, and I’d visit you
in Manhattan. So one morning in March,
in the black coat I’d got for the funeral, I walked east
from the forty-second street Lexington stop
to the three-story, fairy-lit jungle atrium
of the Tricontinental, and went to the seventh floor,
where you started. There was a cart in the hall,
a gleaming chrome maid’s cart half-projecting
from a bedroom. On its sides were rows
of glasses with lace sani-bonnets, gold-
stamped mini-soaps and deodorants. It moved out,
and you stood in the door with a sheet-load, looking fat
in a starchy pink uniform monogrammedPILAR. When you saw me, you dropped the sheets
and in pain, pressed both palms to your cheeks,
and looked at me looking at you. When
I started sobbing, you took my shoulder and backed me
to the elevator. Pressed the button, stepped back,
and then, to my surprise, gave me a sudden hug
before pushing me in.X
It had been always this half-connected
and tenuous, our friendship. What light on my own
isolation and need, that I hadn’t known.
But you actually called me, that week, to propose
our old joke, a bridge walk—maybe Saturday?
Your voice in my ears sounded wobbly
with tension, held-backness, so I got in first:
a friend had wound up her doctorate and left me
a minute Village studio starting June ... After that
I could listen, somber, as you poured out
your need to leave, Luz’s cousin, the possible
hotel job “right in LA.” You added “Anne,” and broke off.
“Well, I’ll tell you that later. Look, it may
snow on Saturday, OK?” “I don’t care.” And before
you hung up, I’d resigned you,
given you up. We’d part, on my side
in anger, on yours in oblivion. I met you
at the foot of the anchorage stair
(not the eastern approach, with its easy grade
near the ramp site). We climbed through the snow,
slowly, pausing at landings for different
views of our old alley world. Like a museum
of disused urban functions—we noted a bricked-over
backyard privy arch, and from higher, roof-huts, inkily distinct,
of old-style tenement dumbwaiters. The whole scene
thrown out of drawing by one of those giant
NYC cable-spools, charred at the bottom
where some homeless had tried to burn it.
The moist snow was sweeping
through the cable tower when we clambered
onto the path beneath it. As we moved, hunched slightly,
onto the mainspan, the whole city abruptly
whited-out to a monochrome geometry
of vertical and stooping gray lines. I thought
how Pequita would have loved it, and caught
her mother’s eye. We went on cautiously, soon
pausing to stamp our boots and look over the rail
at the traffic lanes below us. “Anne, what
I started to say before—this is it: I’m sorry
I didn’t talk to you—you understand?” “Of course,”
I lied aimlessly. But you, glancing sideways,
“But I’m really sorry ...” “No, really ...” You shook
your head slightly, then took my arm. “Okay then—
what’s this thing?” pointing a snowy boot
at a bolt as high as our knees, with a rusted-on octagonal
nut: “It’s just a bolt.” You tapped your glove on a strut—
“strut,” I provided. And you said, pompously, in Luz’ very
intonations (in what spirit had you
listened?)—“The tolerances just aren’t there.”
Then, feeling easier, we started naming everything—
spikes, spun-wire vertical cables: English,
Spanish, and then I heard you speak Quiché (words once
for vines, for split trunks
over gorges?) But everything on the bridge was
shabby, neglected-looking; and you said
soberly: “If anyone was supposed
to look after this bridge, he’s forgot all about it.”
We didn’t link arms again, but started back, pausing
to throw a few loose snowballs
on the Manhattan traffic below us. We’d go
our separate ways—I’d go on delaying, skirting
around my burnt-out places; you’d go
where you could, forget what you could—
some Job-like relinquishment of inquiry
or thought; organisms tend to persist ... When
we got down to the massive base
of the anchorage, we managed a hug
that took in our past, at least: one embrace
of two black winter coats in the snow.

I asked for much; I received much.
I asked for much; I received little, I received
next to nothing.
And between? A few umbrellas opened indoors.
A pair of shoes by mistake on the kitchen table.
O wrong, wrong—it was my nature. I was
hard-hearted, remote. I was
selfish, rigid to the point of tyranny.
But I was always that person, even in early childhood.
Small, dark-haired, dreaded by the other children.
I never changed. Inside the glass, the abstract
tide of fortune turned
from high to low overnight.
Was it the sea? Responding, maybe,
to celestial force? To be safe,
I prayed. I tried to be a better person.
Soon it seemed to me that what began as terror
and matured into moral narcissism
might have become in fact
actual human growth. Maybe
this is what my friends meant, taking my hand,
telling me they understood
the abuse, the incredible shit I accepted,
implying (so I once thought) I was a little sick
to give so much for so little.
Whereas they meant I was good (clasping my hand intensely)—
a good friend and person, not a creature of pathos.
I was not pathetic! I was writ large,
like a queen or a saint.
Well, it all makes for interesting conjecture.
And it occurs to me that what is crucial is to believe
in effort, to believe some good will come of simply trying,
a good completely untainted by the corrupt initiating impulse
to persuade or seduce—
What are we without this?
Whirling in the dark universe,
alone, afraid, unable to influence fate—
What do we have really?
Sad tricks with ladders and shoes,
tricks with salt, impurely motivated recurring
attempts to build character.
What do we have to appease the great forces?
And I think in the end this was the question
that destroyed Agamemnon, there on the beach,
the Greek ships at the ready, the sea
invisible beyond the serene harbor, the future
lethal, unstable: he was a fool, thinking
it could be controlled. He should have saidI have nothing, I am at your mercy.

cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over
the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English.
Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to
scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his hands to lace. On
the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had
dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for
calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of
bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief
commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was
some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot
said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed
himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say
nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries
home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like
dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one
of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water
glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As
for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them-
selves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last
of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some

ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.

And this is what is left of youth! . . .There were two boys, who were bred up together,Shared the same bed, and fed at the same board;Each tried the other’s sport, from their first chase,Young hunters of the butterfly and bee,To when they followed the fleet hare, and triedThe swiftness of the bird. They lay besideThe silver trout stream, watching as the sunPlayed on the bubbles: shared each in the storeOf either’s garden: and together readOf him, the master of the desert isle,Till a low hut, a gun, and a canoe,Bounded their wishes. Or if ever cameA thought of future days, ’twas but to sayThat they would share each other’s lot, and doWonders, no doubt. But this was vain: they partedWith promises of long remembrance, wordsWhose kindness was the heart’s, and those warm tears,Hidden like shame by the young eyes which shed them,But which are thought upon in after-yearsAs what we would give worlds to shed once more.
 They met again, — but different from themselves,At least what each remembered of themselves:The one proud as a soldier of his rank,And of his many battles: and the otherProud of his Indian wealth, and of the skillAnd toil which gathered it; each with a browAnd heart alike darkened by years and care.They met with cold words, and yet colder looks:Each was changed in himself, and yet each thoughtThe other only changed, himself the same.And coldness bred dislike, and rivalryCame like the pestilence o’er some sweet thoughtsThat lingered yet, healthy and beautiful,Amid dark and unkindly ones. And they,Whose boyhood had not known one jarring word,Were strangers in their age: if their eyes met,’Twas but to look contempt, and when they spoke,Their speech was wormwood! . . . . . .

High at the window in her cage         The old canary flits and sings, Nor sees across the curtain pass    The shadow of a swallow’s wings. A poor deceit and copy, this,    Of larger lives that mark their span, Unreckoning of wider worlds    Or gifts that Heaven keeps for man. She gathers piteous bits and shreds,    This solitary, mateless thing, To patient build again the nest    So rudely scattered spring by spring; And sings her brief, unlisted songs,    Her dreams of bird life wild and free, Yet never beats her prison bars    At sound of song from bush or tree. But in my busiest hours I pause,    Held by a sense of urgent speech, Bewildered by that spark-like soul,    Able my very soul to reach. She will be heard; she chirps me loud,    When I forget those gravest cares, Her small provision to supply,    Clear water or her seedsman’s wares. She begs me now for that chief joy    The round great world is made to grow,— Her wisp of greenness. Hear her chide,    Because my answering thought is slow! What can my life seem like to her?    A dull, unpunctual service mine; Stupid before her eager call,    Her flitting steps, her insight fine. To open wide thy prison door,    Poor friend, would give thee to thy foes; And yet a plaintive note I hear,    As if to tell how slowly goes The time of thy long prisoning.    Bird! does some promise keep thee sane? Will there be better days for thee?    Will thy soul too know life again? Ah, none of us have more than this:    If one true friend green leaves can reach From out some fairer, wider place,    And understand our wistful speech!

I'm going to put Karen Prasse right here in front of you on this page so that you won't mistake her for something else, an example of precocity, for instance, a girl who knew that the sky (blue crayon) was above the earth (green crayon) and did not, as you had drawn it, come right down to the green on which your three bears stood. You can tell from her outfit that she is a Brownie. You can tell from her socks that she knows how to line things up, from her mouth that she may grow up mean or simply competent. Do not mistake her for an art critic: when she told you   the first day of first grade that your drawing was ""wrong,"" you stood your ground and told her to look out the window. Miss Voss told your mom you were going to be a good example of something, although you cannot tell from the way your socks sag, nor from your posture, far from Brownie-crisp. This is not about you for a change, but about mis-perception, of which Karen was an early example. Who knows? She may have meant to be helpful, though that is not always a virtue, and gets in the way of some art.

Because I turned the log with my foot.
Her slippers floated downstream into the dam.

Converting work into this passionate play,
A rounded whole made up of different chores

Or puts to rout my primitive elation:
Why be so serious about mere joys?
Is this where some outmoded madness lies,
Poet as recluse? No, what comes to me
Is how my father looked out of his eyes,
And how he fought for his own passionate play.
He could tear up unread and throw away
Communications from officialdom,
And, courteous in every other way,
Would not brook anything that kept him from
Those lively dialogues with man’s whole past
That were his intimate and fruitful pleasure.
Impetuous, impatient to the last,

In a perfumed cloud of dust that loitered over the plain, Hittite ambassadors came to the king with golden bells and rosewater candy, birds in cages and spotted cats, and departed in peace. The king was beloved, laughed often, feared nothing, and died in his bed of poison.                                   A carnelian image of his second-best wife, accurate to the last mole, was plucked from the dirt by a boy tending goats, sold, and spirited out of the country, rolled in a rug, on a ship that sank on a cloudless day.

No, I wasn’t meant to love and be loved.   
If I’d lived longer, I would have waited longer.   
Knowing you are faithless keeps me alive and hungry.   
Knowing you faithful would kill me with joy.   
Delicate are you, and your vows are delicate, too,   
so easily do they break.   
You are a laconic marksman. You leave me   
not dead but perpetually dying.   
I want my friends to heal me, succor me.   
Instead, I get analysis.   
Conflagrations that would make stones drip blood   
are campfires compared to my anguish.   
Two-headed, inescapable anguish!—
Love’s anguish or the anguish of time.   
Another dark, severing, incommunicable night.   
Death would be fine, if I only died once.   
I would have liked a solitary death,   
not this lavish funeral, this grave anyone can visit.   
You are mystical, Ghalib, and, also, you speak beautifully.   
Are you a saint, or just drunk as usual?

I was living in San Francisco  My heart was in Manhattan It made no sense, no reference point  Hearing the sad horns at night,  fragile evocations of female stuff  The 3 tones (the last most resonant) were like warnings, haiku-muezzins at dawn The call came in the afternoon  “Frank, is that really you?” I'd awake chilled at dawn in the wooden house like an old ship  Stay bundled through the day sitting on the stoop to catch the sun I lived near the park whose deep green  over my shoulder made life cooler  Was my spirit faltering, grown duller? I want to be free of poetry's ornaments,  its duty, free of constant irritation,  me in it, what was grander reason  for being? Do it, why? (Why, Frank?)  To make the energies dance etc. My coat a cape of horrors I'd walk through town or impending earthquake. Was that it?  Ominous days. Street shiny with  hallucinatory light on sad dogs, too many religious people, or a woman  startled me by her look of indecision  near the empty stadium I walked back spooked by my own darkness Then Frank called to say “What? Not done complaining yet?  Can't you smell the eucalyptus, have you never neared the Pacific?  ‘While frank and free/call for musick while your veins swell’”  he sang, quoting a metaphysician  ""Don't you know the secret, how to  wake up and see you don't exist, but  that does, don't you see phenomena  is so much more important than this?  I always love that.” “Always?” I cried, wanting to believe him  “Yes.” “But say more! How can you if  it's sad & dead?” “But that's just it!  If! It isn't. It doesn't want to be Do you want to be?” He was warming to his song  “Of course I don't have to put up with as  much as you do these days. These years.  But I do miss the color, the architecture,  the talk. You know, it was the life!  And dying is such an insult. After all  I was in love with breath and I loved  embracing those others, the lovers,  with my body.” He sighed & laughed  He wasn't quite as I'd remembered him  Not less generous, but more abstract  Did he even have a voice now, I wondered  or did I think it up in the middle  of this long day, phone in hand now  dialing Manhattan

Somebody been giving you Stink Eye?
Let me tell you about Stink Eye.
Stink Eye no mean nothing
when you owe somebody money.
Pay up, girl. No be in debt.
But Stink Eye means something
when you owe somebody nothing.
Remember when Connie Mamazuka, the girl with the mustache,
grabbed your lipstick in the PE locker room
and smeared it all over her big fat lips?
Wasn’t ’cause she like your lipstick.
Was ’cause you was one cute skinny chick.
She was giving you Stink Eye all along
and you never even know it.
Now you know it
and now you watch for it.
You was always catching Stink Eye,
always crying to your mother about somebody
icing you out.
When Stink Eye is cold, it is fucking freezing,
it can make you shiver and cry,
“But Mommy, Mommy, what did I do?”
Took you long time to know
you never do nothing
but you was good at something,
something Stink Eye like try steal
not ’cause Stink Eye going use it.
Stink Eye just no like
you use it
’cause if you use it
only going make Stink Eye feel
more ugly, feel more stupid.
Easy for spot
Stink Eye coming from one mousy thing.
More tricky for spot
Stink Eye coming from some of the friendliest faces.
And you the dumb one, left dazed and hurt.
“But she seemed so sympathetic.”
Yeah, right.
Stink Eye sideswipes into you
out of nowhere
where somebody been thinking
evil thoughts about you,
wishing bad luck to blow bad breath upon you,
knock you down,
forget your words,
drop your tools,
make you sputter and drool.
Under the bed,
in Stink Eye’s room,
get one picture of you
stabbed like one pin cushion
with so many needles, stabbed
like one cactus, stabbed like one porcupine.
Stink Eye even dreams about you.
Careful of that coat you wear,
the one you blossom in, feel loved in,
the one that keeps you warm.
Stink Eye like snatch it right off you
’cause Stink Eye just no can stand to see
you look so cool.
Stink Eye wants a piece of you.
So choose to be naive, girl, or wake up
’cause Stink Eye been waiting to sit on your chest,
pounce on your flesh,
squeeze the living air right out of you,
watch you flatten like one used-up tube of toothpaste.
Suck up your goodies,
Glutton-of-Stink-Eye,
ready to gorge on your talents,
feast on your fears.
So girl, run fast, spell good, write well, add up, think quick,
talk sharp, walk pretty, jump high, throw hard, sing sweet,
leap far.
Now you know it
and now you watch for it
’cause Stink Eye gets bigger and meaner and stronger
as you get better and smarter and stronger.
Scary thing about Stink Eye,
Stink Eye always looking for more—
as much as you willing to give.

SILLIANDER and PATCH. THOU so many favours hast receiv'd,Wondrous to tell, and hard to be believ'd,Oh ! H—— D, to my lays attention lend,Hear how two lovers boastingly contend ;Like thee successful, such their bloomy youth,Renown'd alike for gallantry and truth.St. JAMES's bell had toll'd some wretches in,(As tatter'd riding-hoods alone could sin)The happier sinners now their charms put out,And to their manteaus their complexions suit :The opera queens had finish'd half their faces,And city-dames allready taken places ;Fops of all kinds to see the Lion, run ;The beauties stay till the first act's begun,And beaux step home to put fresh linen on.No well-dress'd youth in coffee-house remain'd,But pensive PATCH, who on the window lean'd ;And SILLIANDER, that alert and gay,First pick'd his teeth, and then began to say.SILLIANDER. Why all these sighs ? ah ! why so pensive grown ?Some cause there is that thus you sit alone.Does hapless passion all this sorrow move ?Or dost thou envy where the ladies love ?PATCH. If, whom they love, my envy must pursue,'Tis sure, at least, I never envy You.SILLIANDER. No, I'm unhappy, You are in the right,'Tis You they favour, and 'tis Me they slight.Yet I could tell, but that I hate to boast,A club of ladies where 'tis Me they toast.PATCH. Toasting does seldom any favour prove ;Like us, they never toast the thing they love.A certain Duke one night my health begun ;With chearful pledges round the room it run,Till the young SILVIA press'd to drink it too,Started, and vow'd she knew not what to do :What, drink a fellow's health ! she dy'd with shame :Yet blush'd whenever she pronounc'd my name.SILLIANDER. Ill fates pursue me, may I never findThe dice propitious, or the ladies kind,If fair Miss FLIPPY's fan I did not tear,And one from me she condescends to wear.PATCH. Women are always ready to receive ;'Tis then a favour when the sex will give.A lady (but she is too great to name)Beauteous in person, spotless is her fame,With gentle strugglings let me force this ring ;Another day may give another thing.SILLIANDER. I cou'd say something — see this billet-doux —And as for presents — look upon my shoe —These buckles were not forc'd, nor half a theft,But a young Countess fondly made the gift.PATCH. My Countess is more nice, more artful too,Affects to fly that I may fierce pursue :This snuff-box which I begg'd, she still deny'd,And when I strove to snatch it, seem'd to hide ;She laugh'd and fled, and as I sought to seize,With affectation cramm'd it down her stays :Yet hop'd she did not place it there unseen,I press'd her breasts, and pull'd it from between.SILLIANDER. Last night, as I stood ogling of her Grace,Drinking delicious poison from her face,The soft enchantress did that face decline,Nor ever rais'd her eyes to meet with mine ;With sudden art some secret did pretend,Lean'd cross two chairs to whisper to a friend,While the stiff whalebone with the motion rose,And thousand beauties to my sight expose.PATCH. Early this morn — (but I was ask'd to come)I drank bohea in CÆLIA's dressing-room :Warm from her bed, to me alone within,Her night-gown fasten'd with a single pin ;Her night-cloaths tumbled with resistless grace,And her bright hair play'd careless round her face ;Reaching the kettle, made her gown unpin,She wore no waistcoat, and her shift was thin.SILLIANDER. See TITIANA driving to the park,Hark ! let us follow, 'tis not yet too dark ;In her all beauties of the spring are seen,Her cheeks are rosy, and her mantle green.PATCH. See, TINTORETTA to the opera goes !Haste, or the crowd will not permit our bows ;In her the glory of the heav'ns we view,Her eyes are star-like, and her mantle blue.SILLIANDER. What colour does in CÆLIA's stockings shine ?Reveal that secret, and the prize is thine.PATCH. What are her garters ! tell me if you can ;I'll freely own thee for the happier man.Thus PATCH continued his heroic strain,While SILLIANDER but contends in vain.After a conquest so important gain'd,Unrival'd PATCH in ev'ry ruelle reign'd.

chance to find words; now, by chance, we meet.

Both boys hated school, dropped out feral, dropped in

but your boy killed himself, six days dead.
My boy washed your wall when the police were done.   
He says, “We weren’t friends?” and shakes his head,

there must be some good even inside

Charity? Frances? His last chance

Better love thy neighbor, buddy,

It's probably just a cruddy
downtown interview leading to
some cheap-tie, careerist, dull
cul-de-sac he's speeding to.
Can he catch up with his soul?
Really, what was the freaking crisis?
